 * A temporary file that can be shared between Regina and other

 *
 * In most ways this is just like a QTemporaryFile with autoRemove,
 * except that after share() is called, Regina does not keep the file
 * open to the possible exclusion of other applications.
 *
 * The life cycle of a SharedTempFile is as follows:
 *
 * - The constructor creates the temporary file.  At this point Regina
 *   can write to it, but the underlying QTemporaryFile will remain
 *   open internally which means that external applications may not be
 *   able to access the file.
 *
 * - The routine share() is called.  At this point the underlying
 *   QTemporaryFile is destroyed and Regina no longer keeps the file
 *   open internally, which means that external applications can now read it.
 *
 * - The destructor deletes the file.  This ensures that Regina cleans
 *   up after itself; at this point (of course) no application can access
 *   the file.
 *
 * It is safe to destroy a SharedTempFile before share() is called.
