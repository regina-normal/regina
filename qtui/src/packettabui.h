/**
 * A packet interface consisting of several tabbed pages.
 *
 * At most one of these pages may allow the packet to be edited; this
 * must be of a subclass of PacketEditorTab.  The remaining pages must all
 * be viewers only; each of these must be of a subclass of PacketViewerTab.
 *
 * A tabbed packet interface must contain at least one page; if it has
 * no pages then its behaviour is undefined.
 *
 * A tabbed packet interface may, in addition to its tabbed pages,
 * contain a single header; this is a page that is displayed as a header
 * above everything else.  This must also be a subclass of PacketViewerTab,
 * though it will always be visible and will appear outside the entire
 * tab control.
 *
 * Subclasses of PacketTabbedUI should only need to implement a
 * constructor that sets up the individual pages, with perhaps an
 * override for getPacketTypeActions().  All other PacketUI overrides
 * are simply propagated to the individual pages and should not need to
 * be reimplemented.
