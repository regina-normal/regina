    <p>
      Regina is a software package for 3-manifold and 4-manifold topologists,
      with a focus on triangulations, knots and links, normal surfaces, and
      angle structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 3-manifolds, it includes high-level tasks such as 3-sphere
      recognition, connected sum decomposition and Hakenness testing,
      comes with a rich database of census manifolds, and incorporates the
      SnapPea kernel for working with hyperbolic manifolds.
      For 4-manifolds, it offers a range of combinatorial and algebraic tools,
      plus support for normal hypersurfaces.
      For knots and links, Regina can perform combinatorial manipulation,
      compute knot polynomials, and work with several import/export formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regina comes with a full graphical user interface, as well as
      Python bindings and a low-level C++ programming interface.

      <description>
        <p>
          Maintenance release that fixes some bugs, cleans up some
          unexpected behaviour, and improves compatibility with Python 3.11.

    <release version="7.2" date="2022-10-28">
      <description>
        <p>
          Significant updates for Python users, including comprehensive
          docstrings throughout Regina's API and support for Python 3.11,
          plus a handful of other minor improvements.

    <release version="7.1" date="2022-09-30">
      <description>
        <p>
          Adds intersection forms, thin and normalised links in all facial
          dimensions, handlebody recognition, multithreaded census construction,
          and widespread support for tight encodings, plus several other
          features and improvements.

    <release version="7.0" date="2021-12-19">
      <description>
        <p>
          An enormous update for programmers: the native C++ interface is now
          built around modern language features, and Python is now a
          first-class citizen.  Plus several new topological and algebraic
          features, and a new, more flexible file format.
