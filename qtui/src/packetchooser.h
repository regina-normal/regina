/**
 * A widget through which a single packet can be selected from a
 * subtree.  An optional filter may be applied to the subtree to
 * restrict the available selections.
 *
 * Note that by default the contents of the packet chooser will not be
 * updated in real time if the packet tree is externally modified.  The
 * routine refreshContents() is provided to allow the contents to be manually
 * updated.
 *
 * In particular, if it is possible that the selected packet will be
 * deleted during the lifetime of the packet chooser, it is advisable to
 * call refreshContents() before extracting the packet with selectedPacket().
 * This way the selected packet will be replaced with \c null if it has since
 * been destroyed.
 *
 * By calling setAutoUpdate(), a packet chooser can be modified to
 * update itself automatically in response to packets being renamed or
 * deleted.  However, packet insertions will still go ignored, i.e., no new
 * packets will be automatically added to the chooser.
 *
 * If auto update is on and the selected packet is destroyed,
 * the first option in the combo box will be selected.  Note however
 * that no activated() signal will be emitted since this change was not
 * a result of direct user interaction.
 *
 * Regardless of whatever else happens: the root of the subtree that was
 * originally passed to the constructor will \e not be destroyed, because
 * we hold a shared_ptr to it here.
