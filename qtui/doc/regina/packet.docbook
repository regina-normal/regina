  <para>
   A single Regina data file can store a rich variety of objects, from
   knots, 3-manifold triangulations and normal surfaces through to
   &python; scripts, &pdf; documents and text notes.
   All of these objects are called <firstterm>packets</firstterm>,
   and are arranged in a tree-like structure as you can see below.

   To view or edit a packet, just click on the packet in the tree
   (on some platforms, such as &macosx;, you need to double-click instead).
   The packet will open up in a new window, as shown below.

   There are many different types of packet that you can create in

  <sect2 id="packet-container">
   <title>Container Packets</title>
   <para>
    A <firstterm>container</firstterm> packet helps keep your packet
    tree organised: it can contain other &ldquo;child&rdquo; packets,
    but otherwise it does nothing.

    Containers are marked by the following icon:

   <para>
    To see how containers can be used to organise a tree, take
    a look at one of the census files: try
    <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>File</guimenu>
     <guisubmenu>Open Example</guisubmenu>
     <guimenuitem>Closed Non-Orientable Census</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>.
    Part of the packet tree for this census is shown below (the
    container labelled <guilabel>6&nbsp;tetrahedra</guilabel> has been
    opened for viewing).
   </para>
   <para>
    Note that <emphasis>any</emphasis> packet (not just a container)
    can contain other child packets.

    A <firstterm>3-manifold triangulation</firstterm> packet describes a

   <title>&snappea; Triangulations</title>
   <para>
    A <firstterm>&snappea; triangulation</firstterm> packet stores a
    3-manifold using &snappea;'s internal data structures
    (in contrast, the usual <link linkend="packet-triangulation3">3-manifold
    triangulation packet</link> uses &regina;'s own structures, which are
    independent of &snappea;).
    You can learn more about using &snappea; triangulations in the
    <link linkend="snappea">corresponding chapter</link> later in this handbook.
   </para>
   <para>
    The advantages of using a &snappea; triangulation is that it stores
    additional information that &regina; does not (such as fillings and
    peripheral curves), and it offers more direct access to the &snappea;
    kernel.  The main disadvantage is that you do not have the
    fine-grained control over the triangulation that &regina; offers you
    (in particular, you cannot manipulate the triangulation as freely).
    Of course &regina; offers you facilities to convert one into the other.

     <guimenuitem>Delete</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
    from the menu (or press the corresponding toolbar button),

    If you have selected some packet in the tree but you have different
    packets open for viewing or editing, it is the
    <emphasis>selected packet in the tree</emphasis> that will be
    deleted, not the packets that you are currently viewing.
    Be careful, since deleting a packet cannot be undone!

     <guimenuitem>Move</guimenuitem>

    Selecting <guilabel>Higher Level</guilabel> or
    <guilabel>Lower Level</guilabel> will move the selected packet to a
    different parent (either shallower or deeper in the tree respectively).
    The remaining options will keep the same parent, but will move the
    selected packet up or down with respect to its &ldquo;siblings&rdquo;.
    <guilabel>Up</guilabel> or <guilabel>Down</guilabel> will move the
    packet by one step, and
    <guilabel>Top</guilabel> or <guilabel>Bottom</guilabel> will make it
    the first or last child respectively of its parent.
    <guilabel>Jump Up</guilabel> or <guilabel>Jump Down</guilabel> will move
    the packet several steps at a time; the precise number of steps can be
    configured in &regina;'s <link linkend="options-general">general
