 <title>Triangulations</title>

 <para>
  Manifolds in &regina; are typically represented by
  <firstterm>triangulations</firstterm>.
  A &dmanifold; triangulation consists of a
  set of &dsimplices; along with instructions on
  how some or all of their (<replaceable>d</replaceable>-1)-dimensional
  facets should be glued together in pairs.
 </para>
 <para>
  Most triangulations in &regina; represent 2-, 3- and 4-manifolds.
  We refer to their &dsimplices; as <emphasis>triangles</emphasis>,
  <emphasis>tetrahedra</emphasis> and <emphasis>pentachora</emphasis>
  respectively.
 </para>
 <para>
  &regina; works with <firstterm>generalised triangulations</firstterm>,
  which are less strict than simplicial complexes.
  This means that you may glue two facets of the same &dsimplex; together,
  or you may glue facets so that different vertices of the same &dsimplex;
  become identified (and likewise for edges and so on).
  Indeed, the best triangulations for computation are often
  <emphasis>one-vertex triangulations</emphasis>, where all vertices of
  all simplices become identified together.
 </para>
 <para>
  The downside of this flexibility is that, if you are not careful,
  your triangulation might not represent a &dmanifold; at all.
  This is only a problem for dimensions
  <replaceable>d</replaceable>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;3,
  and if it happens in dimensions
  <replaceable>d</replaceable>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3&nbsp;or&nbsp;4 then &regina; will
  <link linkend="tri-basicprops">tell you about it</link> when you view
  the triangulation.
 </para>
 <para>
  &regina; offers rich support for triangulations of dimensions 2, 3 and 4.
  However, it also offers more basic support for triangulations of
  dimensions 5&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<replaceable>d</replaceable>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;15.
  These higher-dimensional triangulations are not supported in the &gui;;
  instead you will
  need to use either <link linkend="python">&python; scripting</link>
  or <link linkend="compiling">&cpp; programming</link>.
 </para>
 <para>
  The remainder of this chapter talks through triangulations of
  dimensions 2, 3 and 4 only.
 </para>
 <tip>
  <para>
   If you are more familiar with &snappeapylink;, you should be aware that
   &regina; and &snappy; are different programs with different aims,
   and (importantly) with different underlying data structures.
   &snappy; stores information with 3-manifold triangulations
   that &regina; does not (such as fillings
   and peripiheral curves on cusps, which often do not make sense in
   &regina;'s more general setting).
  </para>
  <para>
   If you wish to work with a file from &snappea; or &snappy; and you need to
   preserve &snappy;'s extra information (such as fillings and
   peripheral curves), you should work with a
   <link linkend="snappea">&snappea; triangulation</link> instead.
   The trade-off is that,
   while you will still have access to much of &regina;'s functionality,
   you will lose some of &regina;'s fine-grained control over the
   triangulation (in particular, the ability to
   <link linkend="tri-modification">modify it</link>).
   See the chapter on
   <link linkend="snappea">&snappea; triangulations</link> for details.

     An <firstterm>isomorphism signature</firstterm> is a compact sequence

   <title>Viewing Facet Gluings (All Dimensions)</title>

   <para>
    The <guilabel>Gluings</guilabel> tab shows how the facets of the
    top-dimensional simplices (i.e., edges of triangles, faces of
    tetrahedra or facets of pentachora for 2-, 3- and 4-manifolds
    respectively) are glued to each other in pairs.
   </para>
   <para>
    The facet gluings are presented in a table.
    For a <replaceable>d</replaceable>-manifold triangulation,
    each row represents a <replaceable>d</replaceable>-simplex,
    and the (<replaceable>d</replaceable>+1) columns on the right
    represent the (<replaceable>d</replaceable>+1) facets of each
    <replaceable>d</replaceable>-simplex.
    The <replaceable>d</replaceable>-simplices are numbered 0,1,2,&hellip;,
    and the (<replaceable>d</replaceable>+1) vertices of each
    <replaceable>d</replaceable>-simplex are numbered
    0,1,&hellip;,<replaceable>d</replaceable>.

   </para>
   <para>
    Each cell of this table represents a single facet of a single
    <replaceable>d</replaceable>-simplex.  For instance, in the
    3-manifold example illustrated above, the cell circled in red
    represents face&nbsp;123 of tetrahedron&nbsp;1 (that is, the
    triangular face formed from vertices 1,2,3 of tetrahedron&nbsp;1).
   </para>
   <para>
    The contents of the cell show how the facet is glued.  In the example
    above, the circled cell contains <literal>8&nbsp;(312)</literal>,
    indicating that face&nbsp;123 of tetrahedron&nbsp;1 is glued to
    face&nbsp;312 of tetrahedron&nbsp;8 using the affine map that
    matches vertices 1,2,3 of tetrahedron&nbsp;1 with vertices
    3,1,2 of tetrahedron&nbsp;8 respectively.
    The same gluing can be seen from the opposite direction in the row
    for tetrahedron&nbsp;8.
   </para>
   <para>
    An empty cell indicates that a facet is not glued to anything at all;
    that is, the facet forms part of the <emphasis>boundary</emphasis> of
    the manifold.  In the table above there are two boundary triangles:
    face&nbsp;013 of tetrahedron&nbsp;0, and face&nbsp;123 of
    tetrahedron&nbsp;4.  In our example these join together to form the torus
    boundary of the figure eight knot complement.

        For 3-manifolds, if the triangulation is invalid then we likewise

         For a closed triangulation (no ideal vertices), this is simply
         the number of vertices, edges, triangles and tetrahedra.  For an
         ideal triangulation this takes into account the truncation of
         ideal vertices, and is therefore a little more complex.

       The main drawback is that it can
       vastly increase the total number of tetrahedra.
       This has severe implications if you need to do anything
       computationally intensive with the resulting triangulation.

       <emphasis>Crushing a surface</emphasis> is a potentially destructive
       operation, but when used carefully can be extremely powerful.
       The crushing operation was originally described by
       Jaco and Rubinstein <xref linkend="bib-0-efficiency"/>;
       see <xref linkend="bib-crushing-dcg"/> for a simplified treatment.
       In essence, the surface is first collapsed to a point,
       and then any non-tetrahedron pieces that remain are
       &ldquo;flattened away&rdquo;.

      <para>
       One key advantage of crushing is that it always
       <emphasis>reduces</emphasis> the number of tetrahedra
       (unless you crush vertex links, in which case the triangulation
       stays the same).

       The main disadvantage is that it can change the topology
       of your triangulation, sometimes dramatically.
       For example, it can create ideal vertices, undo connected sums,
       change the genus of boundary components, and delete entire summands.
       In some cases it can even make your triangulation invalid
       (for instance, edges might become identified with themselves in
       reverse).

      <para>
       You should only crush a surface when you have theoretical
       arguments that tell you exactly what might change and how to detect it.
       Examples of such arguments appear in
       <xref linkend="bib-0-efficiency"/>, where crushing is used to
       great effect.

    To cut along or crush a normal surface: open the list of normal
    surfaces, select your surface in the list, and then choose either

     <guimenuitem>Cut Along Surface</guimenuitem>

    &regina; will create a new triangulation where the surface has been
    cut along or crushed accordingly.  This new trianguation will appear
    beneath the normal surfaces in the packet tree.
    Your original triangulation will not be changed.

    Note that you could end up with a disconnected triangulation.
    If so, you can
