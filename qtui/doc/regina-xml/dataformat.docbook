 <title>Current Data File Format</title>

 <partintro>
  <para>
   &regina; data files are saved in an optionally
   compressed &xml; format.  If a data file is compressed, it can be piped
   through <command>gunzip</command> to recover the plain text &xml;.
  </para>
  <para>
   This reference chapter documents the various &xml; elements that form
   a &regina; data file and how they are used.  The top-level element
   for a modern (third-generation) data file is &xml-regina;.
  </para>
  <para>
   &regina;'s file format has gone through a few major changes over the years:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>
     The <emphasis>third-generation</emphasis> format was introduced in
     &regina;&nbsp;7.0, and is the format described here.
     It is an &xml;-based format whose root element is &xml-regina;.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
     The <emphasis>second-generation</emphasis> format was used by &regina;
     versions 3.0&ndash;6.0.1, and is described in full detail in the
     <ulink url="https://regina-normal.github.io/6.0.1/docs/regina-xml/index.html">archived documentation from &regina;&nbsp;6.0.1</ulink>.
     This is also an &xml;-based format, but whose root element is
     &xml-reginadata;.
     &regina; can transparently read second-generation data files, and it can
     also write to them on request.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
     The <emphasis>first-generation</emphasis> format was a binary format
     used by &regina;&nbsp;2.4 and earlier, and was discontinued in mid-2002.
     &regina; can no longer read or write to it at all.
    </para></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>
  <para>
   Regarding international characters:
   As of &regina; version &utf8intro;, all &xml; data is encoded using &utf8;
   (which includes plain &ascii; as a subset).  In versions 4.4 and earlier,
   data was encoded in &latin1; without declaring this explicitly in the
   &xml; header; &regina; is aware of this, and treats all older
   data files as &latin1; when they are loaded.

 <title>Deprecated and Removed Elements</title>

 <partintro>
  <para>
   The following &xml; elements were used in older &regina; data files,
   but are no longer part of the current file format.
  </para>
  <para>
   Those elements that are marked as <emphasis>deprecated</emphasis> can still
   be read by the current version of &regina;, but will not be written when
   a data file is saved.
  </para>
  <para>
   Those elements that are marked as <emphasis>removed</emphasis> can no
   longer be read or written.  If &regina; attempts to read an old data file
   containing removed element(s), those removed elements will be silently
   ignored.
