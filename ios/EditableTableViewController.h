 *
 * - offers a place to register where actions are taking place (the \a actionPath property);
 * - offers a place for deleting cells after confirmation (the \a delete... methods, which
 *   must be overridden);
 * - offers a facility for renaming cells using a long press gesture (the \a rename... methods,
 *   which must likewise be overridden);
 * - offers a facility for additional long-press actions (the \a otherAction... methods,
 *   which need only be overridden if there are additional actions available);
 * - manages the positioning of the table as the keyboard appears and disappears.
 *
 * All other functionality is left for subclasses to implement.
 *
 * You must implement tableView:canEditRowAtIndexPath: in your subclass,
 * to indicate which cells may be deleted.
 *
 * The only table view data source and action sheet delegate methods that this superclass
 * implements (and which subclass implementations must therefore call in this superclass)
