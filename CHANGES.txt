Regina - A Normal Surface Theory Calculator

    This file gives a detailed list of changes between releases,
    including all changes to the C++/Python API.

    For just the key highlights, see the (far more readable) file
    HIGHLIGHTS.txt.

Version 4.97  [ (under development) ]

    GENERAL:
        - Now uses aspects of C++11, which your compiler will need to support.
        - Merged sources for the iPad version into the main source tree.
        - Updated the bundled copy of Normaliz to version 3.0.0 (28 Sep 2015).
        - Switched from std::auto_ptr to std::unique_ptr throughout the API.
        - Many routines of the form getFoo() have been renamed to foo(),
          with the old names deprecated but kept for backward compatibility.
          Likewise, many routines getNumberOfFoo() have been renamed to
          countFoo().  There are too many of these changes to mention, and
          so these are not listed individually below.
        - Much of the triangulation-related code is now dimension-agnostic.
          The new namespaces regina::detail and regina::alias contain
          implementation details that should not concern the end user.
    BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:
        - Some routines have been removed, which may break your old code:
            * NTriangulation::addTetrahedron(), as well as the NTetrahedron
              constructors, have been deprecated since 2011; they are now
              removed completely.  To add tetrahedra to a triangulation,
              call NTriangulation::newTetrahedron() instead.
            * NTriangulation::gluingsHaveChanged() has likewise been deprecated
              since 2011, and has now been removed completely.  This routine
              is no longer necessary (it has done nothing since it was
              deprecated), and you can simply remove it from your code.
            * NProgress, NProgressManager and related classes have been
              deprecated since 2013; they are also removed completely.
              All the code that used to work with these classes now
              works with the newer and more flexible NProgressTracker instead.
    ENGINE:
        All:
            - Removed ShareableObject from the class hierarchy.  All classes
              that used to inherit from ShareableObject now inherit (directly
              or indirectly) from the Output<> template instead.  As a result,
              many such classes no longer contain any virtual functions.
        Namespace regina::boost, regina::stl:
            - Removed these namespaces and all their members.  To fix
              code that used regina::boost, just use plain boost instead.
        Class Component, ComponentBase:
            - Component<dim> is now a generic class that replaces the old
              Dim2Component, NComponent and so on.  ComponentBase<dim> is a
              base class with functionality common to all dimensions,
              whereas Component<dim> is specialised for dimensions 2, 3 and 4.
            - The old class names Dim2Component and NComponent have
              been kept as typedefs for convenience.
        Class CompressionBuffer, CompressionStream, DecompressionBuffer,
                DecompressionStream, ZBuffer:
            - Removed entirely.  Regina now uses boost::iostreams instead.

            - New dimension-agnostic routines countFaces<subdim>() and
              face<subdim>().
            - Now derive from Output instead of ShareableObject.
        Class Dim2Component:
            - New routine getNumberOfBoundaryFacets(), which is identical to
              the dimension-specific getNumberOfBoundaryEdges().
            - New dimension-agnostic routines countFaces<subdim>() and
              face<subdim>().

            - Now just typedefs for the new classes Face<2, 1> and
              FaceEmbedding<2, 1>, which have the same functionality as
              the old Dim2Edge and Dim2EdgeEmbedding respectively.
            - New routine inMaximalForest() for working with the dual
              1-skeleton.
            - Added begin(), end(), front() and back() to Dim2Edge.  In
              particular, this class now supports C++11 range-based for loops.
            - Added getEmbeddings() to Dim2Edge for Python (but not C++).
            - Changed the ordering[] array to a static ordering() function.
            - New faceNumber() function as an "inverse" for ordering().
            - New containsVertex() function for testing which vertices
              belong to which edges.
            - New trivial routines isValid() and isLinkOrientable(), for
              consistency with faces in higher dimensions.
            - Removed the old routine getNumberOfEmbeddings(), and replaced
              it with the new (and equivalent) routine getDegree().
        Class Dim2Isomorphism:
            - Now just a typedef for the new class Isomorphism<2>, which has
              the same functionality as the old Dim2Isomorphism.
            - New static routine identity().
            - Routine getSourceSimplices() is deprecated, and has been
              replaced with the easier-to-type size().
            - Routines findAllIsomorphisms() and findAllSubcomplexesIn() now
              take an arbitrary output iterator, instead of the user passing a
              std::list to fill with results.
        Class Dim2Triangle:
            - Now just a typedef for the new class Simplex<2>, which has
              the same functionality as the old Dim2Triangle.
            - New routine facetInMaximalForest(), for examining a
              precomputed maximal forest in the dual 1-skeleton.
            - New dimension-agnostic face<subdim>(), getFace<subdim>(),
              faceMapping<subdim>() and getFaceMapping<subdim>()
              template functions.
            - You can now safely call unjoin() on a boundary edge.
            - Routine joinTo() has been renamed to join().  The old name
              joinTo() has been kept but is now deprecated.
        Class Dim2Triangulation:
            - Now just a typedef for the new class Triangulation<2>, which has
              the same functionality as the old Dim2Triangulation.

            - Reconstruction from isomorphism signatures now allows
              leading and/or trailing whitespace.

              The old name is deprecated but kept for backward compatibility.
            - New dimension-agnostic routine countBoundaryFacets().
            - Routines getVertices() and getEdges() no longer return a
              reference to a std::vector.  Instead they return a FaceList
              structure, which also supports C++11 range-based for loops and
              operator [] (amongst other things).
            - Routines simplexIndex(), vertexIndex(), edgeIndex(),
              triangleIndex(), componentIndex() and boundaryComponentIndex()
              are all deprecated.  Just call Dim2Vertex::index() and so on
              instead.
        Class Dim2Vertex, Dim2VertexEmbedding:
            - Now just typedefs for the new classes Face<2, 0> and
              FaceEmbedding<2, 0>, which have the same functionality as
              the old Dim2Vertex and Dim2VertexEmbedding respectively.
            - Added begin(), end(), front() and back() to Dim2Vertex.  In
              particular, this class now supports C++11 range-based for loops.

            - Removed getEmbeddings() for C++, but kept it for Python.
            - Removed the old routine getNumberOfEmbeddings().  Just use
              the equivalent routine getDegree() instead.
        Class DimTraits:
            - Removed entirely.  For the typedefs that it used to provide
              (e.g., Triangulation, Simplex, FacetPairing, etc.), just use
              Triangulation<dim>, Simplex<dim>, FacetPairing<dim>, and so on.
        Class Face, FaceEmbedding, FaceBase, FaceEmbeddingBase, FaceStorage:
            - Face<dim, subdim> is now a generic class that replaces the

              Again, FaceEmbeddingBase<dim, subdim> is a base class with
              common functionality, and FaceEmbedding<dim, subdim> is
              specialised for dimensions dim = 2, 3 and 4.

              with NPerm4).
        Class NPerm3, NPerm4, NPerm5:
            - These are now specialisations NPerm<3>, NPerm<4> and NPerm<5>.

        Class NPrismSetSurface:
            - Deprecated this class, which has been little more than a
              placeholder for 12 years.  Also removed its python bindings.
        Class NProgress, NProgressFinished, NProgressManager,
                NProgressMessage, NProgressNumber, NProgressStateNumeric:
            - Removed these old deprecated classes entirely.
        Class NRational:
            - The destructor is no longer virtual.
        Class NSatBlock:
            - Classes inheriting from this must now implement writeTextShort,
              and can optionally overwrite the default writeTextLong function.
        Class NSatBlockSpec:
            - Added == and != comparison operators.
        Class NSFSpace, NSFSSpaceFibre:
            - Added != operators to complement the existing == operators.
        Class NSimpleSurfaceBundle, NSnapPeaCensusManifold, NSnapPeaCensusTri:
            - Added != operators to complement the existing == operators.
        Class NSnapPeaCensusManifold:
            - Change the behaviour of == and != to reflect the recent discovery
              that the manifolds x101 and x103 are homeomorphic.  For details,
              see B.B., "A duplicate pair in the SnapPea census",
              Experimental Mathematics, 23:170-173, 2014.
        Class NSurfaceFilter:
            - The subclass constant filterType is now a constant of type
              SurfaceFilterType, not an anonymous enum type.
        Class NSurfaceFilterProperties:
            - New set-based routine setECs().
        Class NTetrahedron:
            - Now just a typedef for the new class Simplex<3>, which has
              the same functionality as the old NTetrahedron.
            - New routine facetInMaximalForest(), for examining a
              precomputed maximal forest in the dual 1-skeleton.
            - New dimension-agnostic face<subdim>(), getFace<subdim>(),
              faceMapping<subdim>() and getFaceMapping<subdim>()
              template functions.
            - Removed the old deprecated public constructors.  The only way
              to construct a new tetrahedron is via the triangulation, using
              NTriangulation::newTetrahedron() or NTriangulation::newSimplex().
            - Removed deprecated routines getAdjacentTetrahedron(),
              getAdjacentTetrahedronGluing(), getAdjacentFace(), getFace()
              and getFaceMapping().
            - You can now safely call unjoin() on a boundary face.
            - Routine joinTo() has been renamed to join().  The old name
              joinTo() has been kept but is now deprecated.
            - Removed the long-deprecated public constructors.  To create new
              tetrahedra, call NTriangulation::newTetrahedron() instead.
        Class NThread:
            - Deprecated; just use std::thread and related classes instead.
        Class NTreeBag, NTreeDecomposition:
            - Classes for computing tree decompositions of graphs
              (including facet pairing graphs of triangulations).
        Class NTriangle, NTriangleEmbedding:
            - Now just typedefs for the new classes Face<3, 2> and
              FaceEmbedding<3, 2>, which have the same functionality as
              the old NTriangle and NTriangleEmbedding respectively.
            - Added a new Type enumeration to NTriangle, which encapsulates
              (and replaces) the old triangle type constants.  Also added a
              new type constant UNKNOWN_TYPE.
            - New routine inMaximalForest() in NTriangle for working with the
              dual 1-skeleton.
            - Added begin(), end(), front() and back() to NTriangle.  In
              particular, this class now supports C++11 range-based for loops.
            - Added getEmbeddings() to NTriangle for Python (but not C++).
            - Changed the ordering[] array to a static ordering() function.
            - New faceNumber() function as an "inverse" for ordering().
            - New containsVertex() function for testing which vertices
              belong to which triangles.
            - New trivial routines isValid() and isLinkOrientable(), for
              consistency with faces in higher dimensions.
            - Removed the old routine getNumberOfEmbeddings(), and replaced
              it with the new (and equivalent) routine getDegree().
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Now just a typedef for the new class Triangulation<3>, which has
              the same functionality as the old NTriangulation.
            - The routine turaevViro() now computes Turaev-Viro invariants
              using exact arithmetic, as elements of a cyclotomic field.  The
              old floating-point routine has been renamed to turaevViroApprox().
            - The second argument to turaevViro() is now a boolean indicating
              the parity of whichRoot, as opposed to the integer whichRoot
              itself (since in cyclotomic fields, this is all that matters).
            - Both turaevViro() and turaevViroApprox() now offer a default
              value for the second argument (whichRoot / parity), and now take
              an optional third argument to specify which algorithm to use.
            - Both turaevViro() and turaevViroApprox() now offer a treewidth-
              based algorithm.  This can be significantly faster than the old
              backtracking algorithm, but also uses significantly more memory.
              They also now offer two variants of the backtracking algorithm,
              differing in if/how arithmetic operations are cached.
            - Removed Turaev-Viro invariants from the XML data file format.
              Any Turaev-Viro invariants contained in older data files
              (which will be floating-point approximations) will be ignored.
            - Removed the optional boolean argument (forceDivision) from
              idealToFinite().
            - New dimension-agnostic function hasBoundaryFacets().
            - New dimension-agnostic face<subdim>(), getFace<subdim>(),
              faces<subdim>() and getFaces<subdim>() template functions.
            - New routine niceTreeDecomposition() for constructing and
              caching a nice tree decomposition of the face pairing graph.
            - New routines retriangulate() and simplifyExhaustive() for
              breadth-first searching through the Pachner graph.
            - Reconstruction from isomorphism signatures now allows
              leading and/or trailing whitespace.
            - Routine getNumberOfSimplices() has been renamed to size().
              The old names is deprecated but kept for backward compatibility.
            - Routines findAllIsomorphisms() and findAllSubcomplexesIn() now
              take an arbitrary output iterator, instead of the user passing a
              std::list to fill with results.
            - Routines getVertices(), getEdges() and getTriangles() no
              longer return a reference to a std::vector.  Instead they return
              a FaceList structure, which also supports C++11 range-based for
              loops and operator [] (amongst other things).
            - Routines simplexIndex(), vertexIndex(), edgeIndex(),
              triangleIndex(), tetrahedronIndex(), componentIndex() and
              boundaryComponentIndex() are all deprecated.  Just call
              NVertex::index() and so on instead.
            - Removed deprecated routines addTetrahedron() and
              gluingsHaveChanged().
            - Removed maximalForestInDualSkeleton().  Just use
              NTriangle::inMaximalForest() instead.
            - New dimension-agnostic routine countBoundaryFacets().
            - Removed the long-deprecated addTetrahedron().
            - Removed 2-face members FaceIterator, faceIndex(), getFace(),
              getFaces() and getNumberOfFaces(), all of which were deprecated.
              Instead use the names that replace "face" with "triangle".
        Class NVertex:
            - Now just typedefs for the new classes Face<3, 0> and
              FaceEmbedding<3, 0>, which have the same functionality as
              the old NVertex and NVertexEmbedding respectively.
            - Added a new LinkType enumeration to NVertex, which encapsulates
              (and replaces) the old link type constants.
            - Added begin(), end(), front() and back() to NVertex.  In
              particular, this class now supports C++11 range-based for loops.
            - New routines ordering(), faceNumber() and containsVertex(), for
              consistency with higher-dimensional faces.
            - New routine isValid(), which is equivalent to testing whether
              getLink() == NON_STANDARD_BDRY.
            - Removed getEmbeddings() for C++, but kept it for Python.
            - Removed the old routine getNumberOfEmbeddings().  Just use
              the equivalent routine getDegree() instead.
        Class Output, ShortOutput:
            - New classes that provide consistent APIs for objects to provide
              short and detailed string output.  These have been introduced as
              lightweight replacements for the now-defunct ShareableObject.
            - These new classes also provide an output operator << that allows
              any object derived from Output to be written to an output stream.
        Class ReturnsTraits:
            - Helper class for compile-time analysis of function objects.
        Class ShareableObject:
            - Removed entirely.  This is no longer needed as a base class for
              objects that are mirrored in external interfaces (e.g., python).
            - The string output routines str() and detail() are now provided
              by the Output template class instead.
        Class Simplex, SimplexBase:
            - Simplex<dim> is now a generic class that replaces the old
              Dim2Triangle, NTetrahedron and so on.  SimplexBase<dim> is a
              base class with functionality common to all dimensions,
              whereas Simplex<dim> is specialised for dimensions 2, 3 and 4.
            - The old class names Dim2Triangle and NTetrahedron have
              been kept as typedefs for convenience.
        Class Triangulation, TriangulationBase:
            - Triangulation<dim> is now a generic class that replaces the old
              Dim2Triangulation, NTriangulation, etc.  TriangulationBase<dim>
              is a base class with functionality common to all dimensions,
              whereas Triangulation<dim> is specialised for dimensions 2, 3, 4.
            - The old class names Dim2Triangulation and NTriangulation have
              been kept as typedefs for convenience.
        Routine bitsRequired():
            - New constexpr routine for counting bits in an integer.
        Routine digit():
            - New constexpr routine for converting integers into characters.
        Routine factorial():
            - New constexpr routine for computing factorials.
        Routine forCoords(), forFilter(), forPacket():
            - Removed the initial Coords / Filter / PacketType argument,
              which was only used to convey type information and never
              contained any real data.
            - Now supports additional trailing arguments, which are
              passed through to the bracket operator.
            - The void / non-void variants now require that the function
              object must / must not be derived from Returns<T> respectively.
        Routine makeAngleEquations():
            - Added as a global routine so that Python users can access it.
              This is identical to NAngleStructureVector::makeAngleEquations().
        Routine nextPowerOfTwo():
            - New constexpr routine for rounding up to a power of two.
        Routine open():
            - Added a variant that takes an input stream (as opposed to
              a filename).
        Header dim2edgepairing.h, nfacepairing.h:
            - Relocated from census/ into dim2/ and triangulation/ respectively.
              Deprecated headers have been kept in the old census/ folder.
        Header dimtraits.h:
            - Deprecated, since this header is now empty.
        Header ngenericfacetpairing.h, ngenericfacetpairing-impl.h:
            - Moved to generic/facetpairing.h and generic/facetpairing-impl.h.
              The old headers are kept but deprecated.
        Header nperm.h:
            - Removed this deprecated header from the triangulation/ directory.
        Header zstream.h:
            - Removed entirely.  Regina now uses boost::iostreams instead.
        Macro REGINA_INLINE_REQUIRED:
            - New macro to help reduce noisy warnings under windows.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Now builds against Qt5, not Qt4.
        - Supports hi-resolution (e.g., retina) displays.
        - Removed the old and increasingly poorly supported option of
          docking packets into the main window.
        - Drilling an edge now creates a new triangulation, as opposed
          to modifying the current triangulation.
        - Puncturing a triangulation, making it ideal or truncating ideal
          vertices now automatically simplify the resulting triangulation.
        - Now links against Graphviz instead of running it externally.
    PYTHON:
        - For all classes, writeTextShort() and writeTextLong() are no
          longer exposed to Python.  Simply use str() and detail() instead.
        - The behaviour of == and != under python has been formalised.
          For those classes that have == and != operators in C++, the
          python == and != operators compare by value (i.e., they call the
          C++ operators).  For those classes that have neither == nor != in
          C++, the python == and != operators compare by reference.
          Every wrapped C++ class has an equalityType attribute in
          python to indicate which behaviour it uses.
          Thanks to Matthias Goerner for his help with this.

Version 4.96  [ 29 August, 2014 ]

    ENGINE:
        Class BanConstraintBase (and subclasses):
            - Extended the tree traversal / linear programming machinery to
              work with angle structures.  This is used for enumerating all
              taut angle structures, or finding a single strict angle structure.
        Class Dim2BoundaryComponent:
            - New convenience routine getComponent().
            - New routine index().
        Class Dim2Census:
            - Routines formCensus() and formPartialCensus() and the typedef
              AcceptTriangulation are now deprecated.  To build a census
              you should call Dim2EdgePairing::findAllPairings() and
              Dim2GluingPermSearcher::findAllPerms() directly.
        Class Dim2Component:
            - New routine getNumberOfBoundaryEdges().
            - New routine index().
        Class Dim2Edge:
            - New routine index().
        Class Dim2EdgeEmbedding:
            - New convenience operators == and !=.
        Class Dim2Triangle:
            - New routine index().
        Class Dim2Triangulation:
            - New routine isIdenticalTo().
            - New local modification oneThreeMove().
            - New routine findAllIsomorphisms().
            - New routine isEmpty().
            - Several isomorphism-related routines have been moved into
              the dimension-agnostic NGenericTriangulation template, and
              isomorphism signature routines now inherit directly from
              NGenericTriangulation instead of using wrappers.
              See the NGenericTriangulation notes below for details.
            - New routines getNumberOfBoundaryEdges() and hasBoundaryEdges().
              The latter is redundant, but is provided for compatibility with
              NTriangulation.
        Class Dim2Vertex:
            - New routine index().
        Class Dim2VertexEmbedding:
            - New convenience operators == and !=.
        Class LPConstraintBase (and subclasses), LPData, LPInitialTableaux,
              LPMatrix:
            - Extended the tree traversal / linear programming machinery to
              work with angle structures.  This is used for enumerating all
              taut angle structures, or finding a single strict angle structure.
        Class NAbelianGroup:
            - New convenience operator !=.
        Class NAngleStructure:
            - New convenience routine rawVector().
            - Routine getTriangulation() now returns a const NTriangulation*
              (previously this was non-const).  Likewise, many routines in
              this and related classes have NTriangulation* arguments changed
              from non-const to const.
        Class NAngleStructureList:
            - Enumeration of taut angle strutures now uses Regina's tree
              traversal / linear programming machinery, which is *much*
              faster than the old double description method.
            - The new routine enumerateTautDD() allows users to access the
              older (and much slower) double description method if required.
        Class NAngleStructureVector:
            - New routine makeAngleEquations() to build the angle structure
              equations independently of an angle structure list.
        Class NBoundaryComponent:
            - New convenience routine getComponent().
            - New routine index().
            - Renamed getEulerCharacteristic() to getEulerChar(), which
              is easier on the fingers.  The old name has been kept as a
              deprecated alias for backward compatibility.
        Class NCensus:
            - New routine lookup() (in two variants) to quickly search for a
              given triangulation in Regina's various census databases.
              The databases themselves are now installed alongside the
              mathematical engine, and are much larger and richer than before.
            - Routine mightBeMinimal() is deprecated; you should call
              NTriangulation::simplifyToLocalMinimum(false) instead.
            - Routines formCensus() and formPartialCensus() and the typedef
              AcceptTriangulation are now deprecated.  To build a census
              you should call NFacePairing::findAllPairings() and
              NGluingPermSearcher::findAllPerms() directly.
            - The PURGE_... constants have been moved to the
              NGluingPermSearcher class.  The old flags in NCensus
              are deprecated, but have been kept for backward compatibility.
        Class NCensusDB, NCensusHit, NCensusHits:
            - New classes to support the new NCensus::lookup() routines.
        Class NComponent:
            - New routine getNumberOfBoundaryTriangles().
            - New routine index().
        Class NCusp:
            - New class to support NSnapPeaTriangulation.
        Class NEdge:
            - New routine index().
        Class NExampleTriangulation:
            - New example trefoilKnotComplement().
            - New example sphere600() (sourced from the 600-cell in the
              Benedetti-Lutz library of triangulations).
        Class NGenericTriangulation:
            - Moved isIdenticalTo(), isIsomorphicTo(), isContainedIn(),
              findAllSubcomplexesIn() and makeCanonical() from
              Dim2Triangulation and NTriangulation into this class.
            - New routine findAllIsomorphisms().
            - New routine isEmpty().
            - Made isoSig(), fromIsoSig() and isoSigComponentSize() public.
        Class NGluingPermSearcher:
            - New PurgeFlags enumeration, which is the new home for the
              PURGE_... constants that used to live in the NCensus class.
              This enumeration also contains new flags PURGE_NON_MINIMAL_HYP
              (for use in building a census of cusped finite volume hyperbolic
              3-manifolds), and PURGE_NONE.
            - Removed protected routine mayPurge(), since this behaviour is
              already provided by specialised subclasses of NGluingPermSearcher.
        Class NHyperbolicMinSearcher:
            - New enumeration class for building a census of minimal ideal
              triangulations of cusped finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
        Class NManifold:
            - New routine isHyperbolic().
        Class NNormalSurface:
            - Renamed boundarySlopes() to boundaryIntersections(), to make it
              clear that it returns algebraic intersection numbers and not the
              usual (m, l) pairs.  The old name has *not* been deprecated,
              but removed completely.
            - Furthermore, boundaryIntersections() now requires the underlying
              triangulation to be of type NSnapPeaTriangulation, and it takes
              the meridian and longitude directly from the SnapPea kernel.
              It also now orders its rows by SnapPea cusp indices (not Regina's
              vertex indices); this is identical to past behaviour, but now
              that SnapPea triangulations can be modified through the SnapPea
              kernel, it is possible for the numbering schemes to differ
              and so this distinction now matters.
            - Renamed getEulerCharacteristic() to getEulerChar(), which
              is easier on the fingers.  The old name has been kept as a
              deprecated alias for backward compatibility.
            - Renamed the protected routine calculateEulerCharacteristic() to
              calculateEulerChar().
            - Routine getTriangulation() now returns a const NTriangulation*
              (previously this was non-const).  Likewise, many routines in
              this and related classes have NTriangulation* arguments changed
              from non-const to const.
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - New routines saveCSVStandard() and saveCSVEdgeWeight().
              These are now the preferred ways of exporting a normal surface
              list to CSV format.
            - Many routines in this and related classes have NTriangulation*
              arguments changed from non-const to const.  This also applies to
              related global routines, such as makeMatchingEquations().
        Enum NormalCoords:
            - New coordinate system NS_ANGLE for use with angle structures.
        Class NPacket:
            - New routine save(), which is now the preferred way of saving
              Regina data files.
        Class NPDF:
            - New constructor that reads a PDF document from a given file.
            - New routine isNull() to test if a PDF document is stored.
            - New routine savePDF(), which is now the preferred way of
              exporting a PDF packet to a PDF file.
        Class NPerm3, NPerm4, NPerm5:
            - New dimension-agnostic alias invSn.
            - Changed the type of NPerm3::invS3 from int to unsigned,
              for consistenty with NPerm4 and NPerm5.
        Class NScript:
            - Scripts are now stored as complete strings, not sequences
              of individual lines.  This affects the member functions
              (see below) and also the XML file format.  Whilst Regina
              has removed much of the functionality for working line-by-line,
              it can still read older files that were stored that way.
            - A script now fires a change event if one of its variables
              changes its packet label.
            - New routines getText(), setText() and append().
            - New routine getVariableIndex(), setVariableName(),
              setVariableValue() and removeVariable(unsigned long).
            - Removed routines getLine(), getNumberOfLines(), addFirst(),
              addLast(), insertAtPosition(), replaceAtPosition(),
              removeLineAt(), and removeAllLines().  These are not deprecated,
              but removed entirely.
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - Updated the SnapPea kernel to the one shipped with SnapPy 2.2
              (standard precision).
            - NSnapPeaTriangulation is now a fully-fledged packet type, and
              derives from NTriangulation.  The inherited NTriangulation
              must not be modified directly; instead this is automatically
              kept in sync with the SnapPea data.
            - Closed triangulations are now supported always by default
              (i.e., you do not need to explicitly pass allowClosed=true).
              The second argument (allowClosed) for the constructor
              NSnapPeaTriangulation(const NTriangulation&, bool) is
              deprecated, and is now ignored.
            - Many new routines: countCompleteCusps(), countCusps(),
              countFilledCusps(), cusp(), fill(), filledTriangulation(),
              fundamentalGroupFilled(), gluingEquations(),
              gluingEquationsRect(), homologyFilled(), minImaginaryShape(),
              name(), protoCanonize() and protoCanonise(), shape(), unfill(),
              volumeZero(), plus others (listed individually below).
            - Two new constructors: a default constructor that builds a null
              triangulation, and a string constructor that takes either the
              name or the contents of a native SnapPea data file.
            - The Regina-to-SnapPea constructor now doubles as another copy
              constructor: which behaviour you get now depends on whether
              you pass an object of Regina's own NTriangulation type or
              of the subclass NSnapPeaTriangulation.
            - If one of Regina's own NTriangulation objects is passed to
              the constructor, then the constructor now installs the (shortest,
              second-shortest) curves on each cusp as its (meridian, longitude)
              basis.  This reverts a change in behaviour from the previous
              release caused by the recent sync with the SnapPy 2.0.3 kernel.
            - New output routines snapPea() and saveSnapPea().  These override
              the "lossy" conversion routines NTriangulation::snapPea() and
              NTriangulation::saveSnapPea() so that they output all
              SnapPea-specific data.
            - Renamed saveAsSnapPea() to saveSnapPea() (see above).  The new
              routine now returns a boolean, and requires a non-empty filename.
              The old name is deprecated but kept for backward compatibility.
            - Routine dump() is deprecated.  Instead, simply call snapPea() and
              write the resulting string to standard output.
            - Added synonym canonise() for canonize().
            - Routine solutionType() now returns the filled solution type
              (not the complete solution type).
            - Routine slopeEquations() now orders rows by SnapPea cusp indices
              (not Regina's vertex indices).  This is identical to past
              behaviour, but now that SnapPea triangulations can be modified
              through the SnapPea kernel, it is possible for the numbering
              schemes to differ and so this distinction now matters.
            - Routines toRegina() and verifyTriangulation() are deprecated,
              since they are obsolete now that NSnapPeaTriangulation inherits
              from NTriangulation.
            - The entire SnapPea kernel now lives within the namespace
              regina::snappea, which should ensure safety even if a
              conflicting SnapPy kernel is simultaneously loaded via Python.
              The SnapPea kernel is also linked as C++ now (no 'extern "C"').
            - Fatal errors in the SnapPea kernel are now handled by throwing
              exceptions, instead of quitting abruptly.
        Class NTautEnumeration:
            - New class for enumerating taut angle structures that uses
              Regina's tree traversal / linear programming machinery.
              This is *much* faster than the old double description method.
        Class NTetrahedron:
            - New routine index().
        Class NTreeTraversal:
            - Extended the tree traversal / linear programming machinery to
              work with angle structures.  This is used for enumerating all
              taut angle structures, or finding a single strict angle structure.
            - Changed all NTriangulation types in this and related
              classes from non-const to const.
        Class NTriangle:
            - New routine index().
        Class NTriangleEmbedding:
            - New convenience operators == and !=.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New routines hasStrictAngleStructure(),
              findStrictAngleStructure() and knowsStrictAngleStructure(),
              which use fast linear programming machinery.
            - Routine connectedSumDecomposition() now works for non-orientable
              triangulations also (arXiv:1212.1441).  There is a caveat if
              there are embedded two-sided projective planes (see the
              documentation for details), and so the return type is now a
              signed long to allow for error conditions to be returned.
            - New routine connectedSumWith() for building connected sums.
            - New routine isIdenticalTo().
            - New routine isEmpty().
            - New local modification oneFourMove().
            - New routines findAllIsomorphisms() and makeCanonical().
            - Several isomorphism-related routines have been moved into
              the dimension-agnostic NGenericTriangulation template, and
              isomorphism signature routines now inherit directly from
              NGenericTriangulation instead of using wrappers.
              See the NGenericTriangulation notes above for details.
            - New routine getNumberOfBoundaryTriangles().
            - New routine puncture().
            - New routines snapPea(std::ostream&) and saveSnapPea().
              These (and the existing snapPea()) are now the preferred ways
              of exporting an NTriangulation to SnapPea's native file format.
            - New routines recogniser(), recogniser(std::ostream&),
              saveRecogniser(), plus US-spelled variants recognizer(), etc.
              These are now the preferred ways of exporting data for
              Matveev's 3-manifold recogniser.
            - Routines snapPea() and saveSnapPea() now do nothing if the
              triangulation is empty.
        Class NVertex:
            - Renamed getLinkEulerCharacteristic() to getLinkEulerChar(), which
              is easier on the fingers.  The old name has been kept as a
              deprecated alias for backward compatibility.
            - New routine index().
        Class NVertexEmbedding:
            - New convenience operators == and !=.
        Class NXMLSnapPeaReader:
            - New I/O class for the new SnapPea triangulation packet type.
        Class SnapPeaException, SnapPeaFatalError, SnapPeaMemoryFull:
            - New exceptions to be thrown by the SnapPea kernel.
        Enum SurfaceExportFields:
            - Moved from foreign/csvsurfacelist.h to
              surfaces/nnormalsurfacelist.h.
        Routine open():
            - New routine which is now the preferred way to read a
              native Regina data file.
        Routine readFileMagic(), readXMLFile():
            - Renamed to regina::open(), and now declared in npacket.h.
              The old names are deprecated but kept for backward compatibility.
        Routine readPDF():
            - Deprecated, in favour of the new filename-based NPDF constructor.
            - Explicitly return 0 if the given file exists but is empty.
        Routine readSnapPea():
            - Both variants of this routine are now deprecated, in favour of the
              new NSnapPeaTriangulation constructor which preserves additional
              SnapPea-specific data.  The old routines have been kept for
              backward compatibility, and (unlike the new routines) retain
              their old "lossy" behaviour (i.e., returning an NTriangulation
              that drops any SnapPea-specific data, such as peripheral curves).
        Routine writeCSVStandard(), writeCSVEdgeWeight():
            - Renamed to NNormalSurfaceList::saveCSVStandard() and
              NNormalSurfaceList::saveCSVEdgeWeight().  The old names
              are deprecated but have been kept for backward compatibility.
        Routine writePDF():
            - Renamed to NPDF::savePDF().  The old name is deprecated but has
              been kept for backward compatibility.  The new NPDF::savePDF()
              has a slight change in behaviour: if the PDF packet contains
              no data then the old routine created an empty file and returned
              true, whereas the new routine does nothing and returns false.
        Routine writeRecogniser(), writeRecognizer():
            - Renamed to NTriangulation::saveRecogniser() / saveRecognizer().
              The old names are deprecated but kept for backward compatibility.
              The new versions have a change in behaviour, in that they now
              require a non-empty filename (the old behaviour can be recreated
              by calling NTriangulation::recogniser() instead).
        Routine writeSnapPea():
            - The two variants of this routine have been renamed as
              NTriangulation::snapPea(std::ostream&) and
              NTriangulation::saveSnapPea(const char*).  The old names
              are deprecated but have been kept for backward compatibility.
        Routine writeXMLFile():
            - Renamed to NPacket::save().  The old name is deprecated but
              has been kept for backward compatibility.
        Header csvsurfacelist.h:
            - Deprecated.  The declaration of SurfaceExportFields is now
              in surfaces/nnormalsurfacelist.h instead.  The old header
              now includes surfaces/nnormalsurfacelist.h automatically.
        Header nxmlcallback.h, nxmlelementreader.h:
            - Moved from file/ into utilities/.  The old headers have
              been kept for backward compatibility.
        Header permconv.h:
            - New conversion routines perm3to5() and perm5to3().
    USER INTERFACE:
        - The commit/refresh buttons are gone: changes are now committed
          automatically.
        - Many other changes that implement the engine updates listed above.
    UTILITIES:
        censuslookup:
            - New command-line utility for looking up triangulations in
              Regina's census databases.
        tricensus:
            - New argument -h/--minhyp for enumerating minimal ideal
              triangulations of cusped finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
    TEST SUITE:
        - The test suite will no longer be covered by this changelog, since
          changes to the test suite have not been logged thoroughly for some
          years now (i.e., releases typically have many more new tests than are
          being listed here).  If you ever want to see what is currently
          covered by the test suite, you can always run "make test ARGS=-V"
          and watch the tests scroll by.

Version 4.95  [ 12 November, 2013 ]

    GENERAL:
        - Updated the bundled copy of Normaliz to version 2.10.1 (27 June 2013).
        - All 2-faces of a triangulation are now called "triangles" (not
          just "faces" as before).  This is to avoid ambiguity in dimension.
        - Regina and SnapPy can now talk directly via python: on many
          systems, 'import snappy' from either a GUI python console or
          the command-line regina-python tool should work out of the box.
        - Packets in a data file are no longer required to have unique labels.
    ENGINE:
        Class Dim2BoundaryComponent:
            - Detailed string output (via detail() / toStringLong()) now
              outputs details of the constituent edges.
        Class Dim2Component:
            - New routines getNumberOfSimplices() and getSimplex(), which are
              dimension-agnostic aliases for getNumberOfTriangles() and
              getTriangle().
            - New template routine getNumberOfFaces<dim>(), which is a
              dimension-agnostic routine for counting faces of any dimension.
            - Detailed string output (via detail() / toStringLong()) now
              outputs details of the constituent triangles.
        Class Dim2Edge:
            - Detailed string output (via detail() / toStringLong()) now
              outputs details of where the edge appears in each triangle.
        Class Dim2Triangulation:
            - Now inherits from the new helper class NGenericTriangulation<2>.
            - New routine isoSigComponentSize() for extracting the number of
              triangles from a signature (inherited from NGenericTriangulation).
            - New "magic constructor" that attempts to interpret a given
              string as a 2-manifold triangulation under several possible
              encodings (currently only isomorphism signatures are supported
              for 2-manifolds, but this list may grow in the future).
            - Routine isoSig() now takes an optional argument that returns
              the isomorphism with the reconstruction from fromIsoSig().
        Class Dim2Vertex:
            - Detailed string output (via detail() / toStringLong()) now
              outputs details of where the vertex appears in each triangle.
        Class NBoundaryComponent:
            - Renamed getFace() and getNumberOfFaces() to getTriangle()
              and getNumberOfTriangles().  The old names are deprecated but
              have been kept for backward compatibility.
            - Detailed string output (via detail() / toStringLong()) now
              outputs details of the constituent triangles or vertex.
        Class NComponent:
            - Renamed getFace() and getNumberOfFaces() to getTriangle()
              and getNumberOfTriangles().  The old names are deprecated but
              have been kept for backward compatibility.
            - Detailed string output (via detail() / toStringLong()) now
              outputs details of the constituent tetrahedra.
        Class NEdge:
            - Detailed string output (via detail() / toStringLong()) now
              outputs details of where the edge appears in each tetrahedron.
        Class NEulerSearcher:
            - A new subclass of NGluingPermSearcher that can enforce an
              arbitrary fixed Euler characteristic on the vertex links.
        Struct NewNormalSurfaceVector:
            - Moved into registryutils.h and redesigned as the more general
              template struct NewFunction1<>.  The old type is equivalent to
              NewFunction1<NNormalSurfaceVector, size_t>, and a deprecated
              typedef has been kept for backward compatibility.
        Class NExampleTriangulation:
            - Routines weberSeifert() / seifertWeber(), bingsHouse(), weeks()
              and poincareHomologySphere() all now build oriented
              triangulations.
        Class NFace:
            - Renamed to NTriangle.  The old name is deprecated but has
              been kept as a typedef for backward compatibility.
        Class NFaceEmbedding:
            - Renamed the class to NTriangleEmbedding, and renamed getFace()
              to getTriangle().  The old names are deprecated but have been
              kept for backward compatibility.
        Class NGenericFacetPairing:
            - Renamed toString() to the simpler-to-type str().  The old name
              has been kept as a deprecated alias.
        Class NGenericTriangulation:
            - New template helper class that allows different triangulation
              classes to share the same implementations of member functions.
              Currently this class implements isoSig() and fromIsoSig().
        Class NGlobalDirs:
            - Routine pythonModule() now returns an empty string if the
              module is installed in the standard python site-packages
              directory (now the default for an XDG install).
        Class NGroupPresentation:
            - Renamed toStringCompact() to compact().  The old name has
              been kept as a deprecated alias.
        Class NInteger, NLargeInteger:
            - Fixed a (thankfully hard-to-trigger) error in the mod operators.
              The error was triggered on (x % m) or (x %= m) when:
              (i) x was negative and stored as a native integer;
              (ii) m could fit into a native integer but was unnecessarily
              stored as a large GMP integer; (iii) x <= m < |x|.  The result
              was then reported as x (i.e., the mod operation did nothing).
            - Fixed a (thankfully even-harder-to-trigger) error in
              the GCD operation.  This error was triggered only when
              computing gcd(LONG_MIN, 0), for either order of the operands.
        Class NNormalSurface, NNormalSurfaceVector:
            - Renamed getFaceArcs() to getTriangleArcs().  The old name is
              deprecated but has been kept for backward compatibility.
            - Incorporated the new fast branch-and-bound machinery into
              NNormalSurface::isIncompressible().
            - All normal surface vector classes have now gained the enum
              constant coordType (representing the corresponding NormalCoords
              constant), and the typedef Info (representing the
              template specialisation NormalInfo<coordType>).
            - The requirements for new vector subclasses have changed, since the
              old macro-based registry was replaced with the new template-based
              registry.  See the NNormalSurfaceVector class notes for details.
            - Python users can now create a normal surface by hand, e.g.,:
              NNormalSurface(tri, NS_STANDARD, [ 1, 2, 0, ... ]).
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - Re-enabled enumeration using NS_HILBERT_FULLCONE, which previously
              returned an empty list.  Users will not be affected unless
              they were explicitly asking for this much slower algorithm.
            - Routine flavour() has been renamed to coords().  The old
              name remains for now as a deprecated alias.
        Class NNormalSurfaceSubset:
            - Routine getFlavour() has been renamed to coords().  The old
              name remains for now as a deprecated alias.
        Enum NormalCoords:
            - Renamed NS_FACE_ARCS to NS_TRIANGLE_ARCS.  The old name is
              deprecated but has been kept for backward compatibility.
        Class NormalFlavour<...>, NormalInfo<...>:
            - This recently-added registry helper template has changed since
              the last release.  Since this is a very new class whose primary
              role is in the redesign of the coordinate system registry,
              no backward compatibility aliases are provided.
            - The template itself has been renamed from NormalFlavour<...>
              to NormalInfo<...>.
            - The declaration has moved from flavourregistry.h to
              normalsurface.h, and the specialisations have moved to the
              corresponding coordinate system headers (nsstandard.h and so on).
            - The typedefs Vector, StandardFlavour and ReducedFlavour
              have been renamed to Class, Standard and Reduced.
        Class NPacket:
            - The requirements for new subclasses have changed, since the old
              macro-based registery was replaced with the new template-based
              registry.  See the NPacket class notes for details.
            - The constant packetType is now a compile-time enum constant,
              not a static const int.
            - The new routine getHumanLabel() returns the packet label,
              but adjusted for human-readable output.  In particular, an
              empty label will be replaced by "(no label)".
            - Routine getFullName() now makes labels more suitable for
              human-readable output as described above.
            - New routine internalID() to produce a string that uniquely
              identifies the packet (which nowadays the packet label does not).
        Class NPerm3, NPerm4, NPerm5:
            - New dimension-agnostic aliases orderedSn, SnIndex() and
              orderedSnIndex().  These all reference existing arrays/routines
              involving S3, S4 or S5 in NPerm3, NPerm4 and NPerm5 respectively.
            - Renamed toString() to the simper-to-type str().  The old name
              has been kept as a deprecated alias.
        Class NPillowTwoSphere:
            - Renamed getFace() and getFaceMapping() to getTriangle()
              and getTriangleMapping().  The old names are deprecated but
              have been kept for backward compatibility.
        Class NScript:
            - Variables are now stored as pointers to packets, not string-based
              packet labels.  This affects the API (in a non-backward-
              compatible way), the behaviour (e.g., renaming a packet will
              not affect any script variable that references it), and the
              data file format (packets now have IDs that scripts can use to
              reference them).
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - Updated the SnapPea kernel to the one shipped with SnapPy 2.0.3.
            - New routines randomize() / randomise() to randomly retriangulate.
        Class NSurfaceFilter:
            - The requirements for new subclasses have changed, since the old
              macro-based registry was replaced with the new template-based
              registry.  See the NSurfaceFilter class notes for details.
            - The constant filterID has been renamed to filterType, and
              is now a compile-time enum constant (not a static const int).
              The old name has been kept as a deprecated alias.
            - Routines getFilterID() and getFilterName() have been renamed
              to getFilterType() and getFilterTypeName().  The old names
              have been kept as deprecated aliases.
        Class NTetrahedron:
            - Renamed getFace() and getFaceMapping() to getTriangle()
              and getTriangleMapping().  The old names are deprecated but
              have been kept for backward compatibility.
        Class NThread:
            - New routine join() to wait for threads to finish.
        Class NTriangle:
            - Detailed string output (via detail() / toStringLong()) now
              outputs details of where the triangle appears in each tetrahedron.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New routines isIrreducible(), knowsIrreducible(),
              isHaken(), knowsHaken(), and knowsCompressingDisc().
            - Routine hasCompressingDisc() has been updated to use the new
              fast branch-and-bound machinery.
            - New routines getNumberOfSimplices() and getSimplex(), which are
              dimension-agnostic aliases for getNumberOfTetrahedra() and
              getTetrahedron().
            - New template routine getNumberOfFaces<dim>(), which is a
              dimension-agnostic routine for counting faces of any dimension.
            - Now inherits from the new helper class NGenericTriangulation<3>.
            - New routine isoSigComponentSize() for extracting the number of
              triangles from a signature (inherited from NGenericTriangulation).
            - Routine isoSig() now takes an optional argument that returns
              the isomorphism with the reconstruction from fromIsoSig().
            - New routines snapPea() and fromSnapPea() to import and export
              SnapPea data using strings, without writing to the filesystem.
            - New "magic constructor" that attempts to interpret a given
              string as a 3-manifold triangulation under several possible
              encodings.
            - Routine isThreeSphere() now includes a fast check for an
              "obviously" trivial fundamental group.
            - Renamed FaceIterator, faceIndex(), getFace(), getFaces(),
              getNumberOfFaces() and hasBoundaryFaces(), where "face"
              now becomes "triangle".  The old names are deprecated but
              have been kept for backward compatibility.
            - Results from hasCompressingDisc() and isHaken() are now
              stored in data files.
            - The output from getPacketTypeName() has changed from
              "Triangulation" to "3-Manifold Triangulation".
        Class NVertex:
            - Added buildLinkDetail(), which returns details of how triangles
              of the vertex link are embedded within individual tetrahedra.
            - Detailed string output (via detail() / toStringLong()) now
              outputs details of where the vertex appears in each tetrahedron.
        Class NXMLPacketReader, NXMLTreeResolver, NXMLTreeResolutionTask:
            - The API for reading packets from an XML data file has changed to
              incorporate the new NXMLTreeResolver class, which allows the
              resolution of dangling packet references after an entire
              data file has been read.
        Class PacketInfo:
            - Template classes that store traits of the various packet types.
              These are used with the new forPacket() template functions.
        Enum PacketType:
            - A new enumeration that contains constants representing
              different packet types.  Include "packet/packettype.h".
        Struct Returns:
            - Moved into utilities/registry.h.  However, its contents are
              still included from its previous header surfaces/filterregistry.h.
        Class ShareableObject:
            - Renamed toString() and toStringLong() to the simper-to-type str()
              and detail().  The old names have been kept as deprecated aliases.
        Class SurfaceFilterInfo:
            - Template classes that store traits of the various normal
              surface filter classes.  These are used with the new
              forFilter() template functions.
        Enum SurfaceFilterType:
            - A new enumeration that contains constants for different types of
              normal surface filter.  Include "surfaces/surfacefiltertype.h".
        Routine forFlavour(), forCoords():
            - Renamed each variant of forFlavour() to forCoords().  The
              old names have been kept as deprecated aliases.
        Routine stringToToken():
            - Moved from foreign/snappea.h into utilities/stringutils.h.
        Routine readSnapPea(), writeSnapPea():
            - Added istream/ostream versions of these routines.
            - In writeSnapPea(), the NTriangulation& argument is now const.
        Headers dimtraits.h, nfacetspec.h, ngenericisomorphism.{h,tcc}:
            - Moved from triangulation/ to generic/.  The old header locations
              are now deprecated.  They have been kept for backward
              compatibility, but simply include the new headers instead.
        Header filterregistry.h:
            - The REGISTER_FILTER macros have been removed.  To iterate through
              surface filter types, use the new forFilter() template functions.
        Header flavourregistry.h, coordregistry.h:
            - Renamed flavourregistry.h to coordregistry.h.  The old header
              has been kept as a deprecated alias.
            - The REGISTER_FLAVOUR macros have been removed.  To iterate through
              coordinate systems, use the forCoords() template functions.
        Header packetregistry.h:
            - The REGISTER_PACKET macros have been removed.  To iterate through
              packet types, use the new forPacket() template functions.
        Headers *.tcc:
            - All *.tcc headers have been renamed as *-impl.h, to play
              better with development IDEs.  The old header names are now
              deprecated but have likewise been kept for backward compatibility.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - The root container packet is now hidden from the user (it still
          exists internally within the packet tree).
        - The triangulation viewer now explicitly states "not oriented"
          for orientable-but-not-oriented triangulations.
        - The old regina-kde placeholder app (which did nothing but pop up
          a message directing the user to the new regina-gui) has been removed.
        - The boundary component viewer now displays more detailed information.
    PYTHON:
        - The python module 'regina' now has its own __init__.py, and loads
          'regina.engine' as an extension submodule.  All symbols from
          regina.engine are imported directly into 'regina', so users can
          continue to work directly with the 'regina' namespace as before.
        - For an XDG build (e.g., on GNU/Linux), the python module is now
          installed in the standard python site-packages directory, which
          means you can easily import the module from a normal python session.
        - Added a useful __repr__ for the core types NInteger, NLargeInteger,
          NRational, NPerm3, NPerm4 and NPerm5.
    TEST SUITE:
        - More NInteger / NLargeInteger tests, this time comparing operations
          when the same arguments are coerced from natives to GMP integers.
        - NBitmask tests for the bits() function.
        - Added python tests for the Orb import filter; thanks to
          Craig Hodgson for the sample files.

Version 4.94  [ 24 September, 2013 ]

    GENERAL:
        - Old-style binary files are no longer supported.  These have not been
          in use for over a decade.  If you have an old-style binary file that
          you need to use, install Regina 4.93 and use the regconvert tool.
        - Widespread alignment of integer sizes throughout the code.
          Many integers have changed from int to long, or from unsigned to
          unsigned long (or size_t), throughout the API.
        - Fixed some minor memory leaks.

        Class NAngleStructure:
            - Removed writeToFile(NFile&) and readFromFile(NFile&, ...),
              which were used for old-style binary files.

        Class Flags:
            - New template class for forming bitwise combinations of
              flags based on enumeration values.
        Class HashPointer, HashString:
            - Removed, after being deprecated for a very long time now.
        Class IntOfSize:
            - New template class for using native integer types whose sizes
              are not determined until compile time.
        Class LPConstraintBase, LPConstraintSubspace, LPConstraintNone,
                LPConstraintEuler, LPConstraintNonSpun:
            - New constraint classes for use with the new tree traversal code

            - Now supports Seifert fibred spaces with boundary.
        Class NCensus:
            - The NProgressManager* argument has been removed from formCensus().
              If you are doing serious census generation, use the command-line
              utility tricensus (or tricensus-mpi) instead.
        Class NClosedPrimeMinSearcher, NCompactSearcher:
            - Improved the way in which cones and L(3,1) spines are
              detected and pruned during census enumeration.
            - Improved the way in which too many high degree edges are
              detected and pruned during census enumeration.
        Class NDoubleDescription:
            - More frequent polling for cancellation.
            - The progress tracker passed to enumerateExtremalRays() is now of
              class NProgresstracker, not NProgressNumber.
        Class NEdge:
            - New convenience routine getTriangulation().
        Class NEnumConstraintList:
            - This now holds unsigned longs, not unsigned ints, for
              consistency with the integer types used for NVector indexing.
        Class NFace:
            - New convenience routine getTriangulation().
        Class NFacePairing:
            - Now derives from the template base class NGenericFacetPairing<3>.
            - Renamed getNumberOfTetrahedra() to size().  The old name
              is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.
        Class NFile, NFilePropertyReader:
            - Removed these classes, which were used for old-style binary files.

              code for representing face/facet pairings.
        Class NGenericIsomorphism:
            - New template base class that contains dimension-agnostic
              code for representing isomorphisms between triangulations.
        Class NGroupExpression:
            - New routines wordLength(), erase(), cycleLeft(), cycleRight(),
              invert(), writeTeX(), and a version of writeText()
              that takes an extra argument to control the output style.
        Class NGroupPresentation:
            - Finally intelligentSimplify() really is intelligent.  It
              now uses Dehn simplification / small cancellation theory.
            - New routine intelligentSimplify(NHomGroupPresentation*)
              for keeping track of how the group was simplified.
            - New routines relatorLength(), abelianlisation(),
              markedAbelianisation(), writeTeX(), toTeX(),
              writeTextCompact() and toStringCompact().
            - More readable output from writeTextLong().
            - New assignment operator (=).
        Class NHilbertCD:
            - The NProgressMessage* argument to enumerateHilbertBasis()
              has been removed, since in reality the current algorithm offers
              no sensible progress tracking or cancellation polling.
        Class NHilbertDual:
            - More frequent polling for cancellation.
            - The progress tracker passed to enumerateHilbertBasis() is now of
              class NProgressTracker, not NProgressNumber.
        Class NHilbertPrimal:
            - The progress tracker passed to enumerateHilbertBasis() is now of

            - Removed all dependencies on the old NIndexedArray.
        Class NIndexedArray:
            - Removed, after being deprecated for a very long time now.
        Class NInteger:
            - NInteger is a typedef for the new template class
              NIntegerBase<false>, which offers fast arbitrary precision
              integers but does not support infinity.
        Class NIntegerBase:
            - This is a new template class that supercedes (and is based on)
              the old NLargeInteger.  The boolean template argument indicates
              whether the class supports infinity as an allowed value.
            - Heavily rewritten from the old NLargeInteger: this class works
              with native C/C++ integers for as long as possible, and only
              switche to GMP when it becomes unavoidable.  This makes the code
              enormously faster (rough testing suggests a roughly 7x speedup).
            - Made the destructor non-virtual to avoid the unwanted class
              overhead that comes with polymorphism.
            - Added new routines that were not in the old NLargeInteger,
              including isZero(), sign(), gcdWith(), lcmWith(), and
              nativeValue<bytes>().
        Class NIsomorphism:
            - Now a subclass of NGenericIsomorphism<3>, with inherited
              dimension-agnostic aliases for several routines.
        Class NLargeInteger:
            - NLargeInteger is now a typedef for the new template class
              NIntegerBase<true>, and maintains backward compatibility.
            - Performance is much, much faster; see NIntegerBase for details.
        Class NLocalFileResource, NRandomAccessResource:
            - Removed these classes, which were used for old-style binary files.
        Class NMarkedAbelianGroup:
            - New routines torsionSubgroup() and torsionInclusion().
        Class NMatrix:
            - New routine isZero().
        Class NNativeInteger:
            - New template class that wraps native integer types with very
              little overhead and offers an interface compatible with NInteger.
        Class NNativeLong:
            - A convenience typedef for the new class NNativeInteger<long>.
        Class NNormalSurface:
            - Routine boundarySlopes() now requires that the
              triangulation is oriented (otherwise SnapPea will relabel
              tetrahedron vertices and the matrix returned will be null).
            - Routines findNonTrivialSphere() and findVtxOctAlmostNormalSphere()
              are deprecated.  Use NTriangulation::hasNonTrivialSphereOrDisc()
              and NTriangulation::hasOctagonalAlmostNormalSphere() instead.
            - Removed writeToFile(NFile&) and readFromFile(NFile&, ...),
              which were used for old-style binary files.
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - New routines which() and algorithm() now retain details of
              which surfaces where enumerated and how this was done.
            - Now uses the new tree traversal method as a preferred
              enumeration algorithm where possible.  This is a significant
              improvement upon the old double description method.  See
              NTreeEnumeration and arXiv:1010.6200 for details.
            - The coordinate flavours (STANDARD, QUAD, etc.) are deprecated,
              and have changed from integers to NormalCoords enum types.
              Instead of these, use the NormalCoords enum values directly
              (NS_STANDARD, NS_QUAD, etc.).  For both C++ and Python users,
              these enum values are available directly in the namespace scope.
            - More frequent and robust cancellation checking during
              enumeration of vertex surfaces.
            - The old enumeration routines have been deprecated.  These
              include enumerate(NTriangulation*, int, bool, NProgressManager*),
              enumerateStandardDirect(), enumerateStandardANDirect(),
              enumerateFundPrimal(), enumerateFundDual(),
              enumerateFundCD() and enumerateFundFullCone().
              Users should now use the "universal" enumeration routine
              enumerate(NTriangulation*, NormalCoords, NormalList, NormalAlg,
              NProgressTracker*), which offers sensible default as well
              as fine-grained control over the underlying algorithms.
            - In all enumeration routines that take progress trackers, the
              old-style NProgressManager* arguments have been replaced with
              NProgressTracker* arguments, which are more flexible and
              more streamlined.
            - The routine getFlavour() is now renamed to flavour().
              The old getFlavour() is still available but deprected.
            - This class no longer inherits from NSurfaceSet (which has been
              removed).  As a result, getShareableObject() is no longer
              necessary and has likewise been removed.
        Enum NormalCoords:
            - A new enumeration that contains constants for different normal
              surface coordinate systems.  Include "surfaces/normalcoords.h".
        Class NormalFlavour:
            - Template classes that store traits of the various normal
              surface coordinate systems.  These are used with the new
              forFlavour() template functions.
        Enum NormalListFlags, Class NormalList:
            - Flags that specify which normal surfaces a particular list
              represents within a given triangulation.
        Enum NormalAlgFlags, Class NormalAlg:
            - Flags that specify details and parameters of normal surface
              enumeration algorithms.
        Class NPacket:
            - Fix crash when sortChildren() is run on the root packet.
            - Removed writePacket(NFile&) and readPacket(NFile&), which
              were used for old-style binary files.
        Class NPerm3, NPerm4, NPerm5:
            - New dimension-agnostic alias Sn that refers to S3, S4 and S5 in
              NPerm3, NPerm4 and NPerm5 respectively.
            - New dimension-agnostic alias Sn_1 that refers to S2, S3 and S4 in
              NPerm3, NPerm4 and NPerm5 respectively.
            - New dimension-agnostic enum constants nPerms and nPerms_1 that
              contain the number of permutations in Sn and Sn_1 respectively.
            - New construtors that take an array of images.
            - NPerm3 and NPerm5 now have a copy of S2 (which NPerm4 already
              had).  Likewise, NPerm5 now has a copy of S3, orderedS3,
              S4 and orderedS4 (which NPerm4 again already had).
            - NPerm4::invS2 and NPerm4::invS3 are deprecated: the former
              is unnecessary, and the latter is identical to NPerm3::invS3.
            - NPerm3 now has a transposition constructor: NPerm3(a,b).
        Class NProgress, NProgressFinished, NProgressManager,
                NProgressMessage, NProgressNumber, NProgressStateNumeric:
            - Deprecated in favour of the new NProgressTracker (see below).
        Class NProgressTracker:
            - A new unified and streamlined progress tracking mechanism that
              replaces the old suite of NProgress classes (i.e.,
              NProgressManager and the NProgress class hierarchy).
        Class NQitmask1, NQitmask2:
            - Fast classes for working with 0/1/2/3 "qits", i.e., "base 4 bits".
        Class NSatBlock:
            - Routine nextBoundaryAnnulus() has acquired an extra boolean
              argument, which allows us to choose between "next" and "previous".
        Class NSatRegion:
            - Routine createSFS() no longer need to be given the number
              of boundary components, and now supports Klein bottle
              boundaries.  The old two-argument version is now deprecated.
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - Updated the SnapPea kernel to the one shipped with SnapPy 1.8.0.
            - New routine toRegina() to extract the underlying SnapPea
              triangulation, or to see exactly how SnapPea has relabelled
              and/or retriangulated.
            - New routine canonize() to produce the canonical retriangulation
              of the canonical cell decomposition.
        Class NSurfaceFilter:
            - Removed writeFilter(NFile&) and readFilter(NFile&, ...),
              which were used for old-style binary files.
        Class NSurfaceSet:
            - Removed.  The corresponding functionality has been moved directly
              into the subclasses NNormalSurfaceList and NSurfaceSubset.
        Class NSurfaceSubset:
            - No longer inherits from NSurfaceSet (which has been removed).
              As a result, getShareableObject() is no longer necessary and
              has likewise been removed.
            - The constructor now takes a reference to an NNormalSurfaceList,
              not an NSurfaceSet.
        Class NTetrahedron:
            - New dimension-agnostic aliases adjacentSimplex() and
              adjacentFacet().  These are identical to adjacentTetrahedron()
              and adjacentFace() respectively, and can help with
              writing code that works with more than one dimension.
        Class NTreeTraversal, NTreeEnumeration, NTreeSingleSolution:
            - New class for enumerating vertex normal surfaces and
              locating a single vertex normal surface under some linear
              constraint (such as positive Euler characteristic).  These are a
              significant improvement upon the old double description method.
              For details see arXiv:1010.6200 and arXiv:1211.1079 respectively.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New routine drillEdge() to drill out a regular
              neighbourhood of an edge.
            - New optimised routines hasNonTrivialSphereOrDisc() and
              hasOctagonalAlmostNormalSphere() that use linear programming
              where possible to avoid a full enumeration of vertex surfaces.
              See arXiv:1211.1079 for details.
            - Some routines are now *much* faster for larger triangulations,
              thanks to the new linear programming code (arXiv:1211.1079).
              These include isZeroEfficient(), isThreeSphere(), isSolidTorus(),
              connectedSumDecomposition(), and makeZeroEfficient().
            - Rewrote barycentricSubdivision(): the code is now clearer,
              but note that the precise labelling of the new tetrahedra has
              changed from earlier versions of Regina.
            - Routine insertTriangulation() now works in the case where
              a triangulation tries to insert itself.
            - New dimension-agnostic aliases getNumberOfSimplices(),
              getSimplices(), getSimplex(), simplexIndex(), newSimplex(),
              removeSimplex(), removeSimplexAt() and removeAllSimplices().
              These are identical to the corresponding routines for
              operating on tetrahedra, and can help with writing code that
              works with more than one dimension.
            - Fixed isZeroEfficient(), which was reporting incorrect results
              for ideal triangulations.
            - Removed the old (and slow) getTetrahedronIndex(), getFaceIndex()
              and so on.  Use tetrahedronIndex(), faceIndex(), etc. instead.
            - All routines that took stdhash::hash_set arguments now take
              std::set arguments instead.
        Class NTritmask1, NTritmask2:
            - Fast classes for working with 0/1/2 trits, i.e., "ternary bits".
        Class NTypeTrie:
            - A fast data structure for storing zero/non-zero patterns in
              vertex normal surfaces.  This supports the new tree
              traversal enumeration code; see NTreeTraversal for details.
        Class NVertex:
            - New routine buildLink() to triangulate the vertex link.
            - New convenience routine getTriangulation().
        Class ZBuffer:
            - Updated xsgetn() to support n larger than UINT_MAX.
        Routine base64Decode(), base64Encode():
            - Replace the old GPL-licensed implementation with a different
              MIT-licensed implementation.  Functionality is the same.
        Routine forFlavour():
            - New template functions that offer a typesafe way of iterating
              through cases of different normal coordinate systems without
              abusing the C++ preprocessor.  These should be used instead of
              the old (and now deprecated) REGISTER_FLAVOUR macros.  Variants
              of forFlavour() are offered for different function types.
        Routine readFromFile(), writeToFile():
            - Removed, since these were used with old-style binary files.
        Routine readOrb():
            - Updated to correctly read the modern (and more verbose)
              Orb file format.  Thanks to Lorenzo Losa for the patch.
        Typedef NFacePairingIsoList, UseFacePairing:
            - These typedefs have been renamed as NFacePairing::IsoList
              and NFacePairing::Use respectively.  The old typedefs are
              deprecated, and will be removed in some future release.
        Header flavourregistry.h:
            - The old REGISTER_FLAVOUR macros are now deprecated, and will
              eventually be removed.  The preferred way to iterate through
              coordinate flavours is the new forFlavour() template functions.
        Header hashmap.h, hashset.h, hashutils.h:
            - Removed, after being deprecated for a very long time now.
        Header nlargeinteger.h:
            - Deprecated in favour of the new ninteger.h.
    USER INTERFACE:
        In addition to incorporating the new mathematical changes above:
            - The preference dialog is somewhat simpler now.
              + Some preferences are gone, and instead Regina simply remembers
                your last selection (e.g., default tabs for various viewers).
              + Some preferences have just been removed from the dialog (e.g.,
                the calculations thresholds), though users who really need
                these can still access them through the configuration file.
            - The elementary move dialog contains richer information
              about where the moves can take place, and stays open so that
              you can perform several moves one after another.
    UTILITIES:
        regconvert:
            - The option -b (for old-style binary files) is no longer supported.
        regina-python:
            - Enabled tab completion, courtesy of readline and rlcompleter.
            - The --quiet option no longer lists libraries as they are loaded.
        tricensus:
            - Now takes an optional argument -2/--dim2 to enumerate
              2-manifold triangulations.
            - Now takes an optional argument -c/--subcontainers to store
              triangulations in subcontainers according to face pairings.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Greatly expanded the tests for NLargeInteger and NInteger,
          which are now extremely thorough.
        - New and more thorough NTriangulation tests for barycentric
          subdivision, drilling edges, 0-efficiency testing, 3-sphere
          recognition, connected sum decomposition, solid torus recognition,
          and comparing H1 with the abelianised fundamental group.
        - New NNormalSurfaceList tests for comparing the results of different
          vertex / fundamental surface enumeration algorithms.  Also,
          exhaustive tests over census data now include ideal triangulations.
        - New enumeration tests for Dim2EdgePairing and Dim2Census.
        - New tests for permutation databases Sk and orderedSk.
        - New tests for base64 conversion.
        - Expanded tests for the NRational class.
        - Expanded enumeration tests for facet pairing classes to
          include pairings with boundary facets.

Version 4.93  [ 30 May, 2012 ]

    ENGINE:
        Class NAngleStructure:
            - New routine isVeering() to test for veering structures.
            - Flags (taut/strict/veering) are no longer stored in data files.
        Class NBlockedSFSLoop, NBlockedSFSTriple, NPluggedTorusBundle:
            - Corrected an off-by-one error in computing the genus of certain
              non-orientable base orbifolds for Seifert fibred pieces.
              This only affects census manifolds with >= 12 tetrahedra;
              in particular, no existing census data is affected.
        Class NExampleTriangulation:
            - New routine weeks() to build the Weeks manifold.
        Class NNormalSurface:
            - Routines isOrientable(), isTwoSided() and isConnected() now
              return bool instead of NTriBool.  This helps avoid unintended
              errors in scripts, but be warned: these properties can only be
              computed for compact surfaces (not spun normal surfaces).
            - Routines isIncompressible() and isCompressingDisc() likewise
              now return bool instead of NTriBool.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New routines isSolidTorus() and knowsSolidTorus()
              for "one-click unknot recognition".
            - Routine hasCompressingDisc() now returns bool instead of NTriBool.
        Class NTriBool:
            - Deprecated.  This class has been replaced with ordinary (two-way)
              bool throughout Regina, and will be removed in a future release.
        Routine writeRecogniser():
            - Added to support sending triangulations to Matveev's
              3-manifold recogniser software.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Restored File -> Save and File ->Save As, which were missing from
          the main menu in version 4.92.
        - In the triangulation viewer, the old "Surfaces" tab has been renamed
          as the "Recognition" tab, and includes high-level algorithms such as
          3-sphere recognition as well as "opportunistic" combinatorial
          recognition.
        - Replaced the python icon with a generic terminal icon.
        - GUI python consoles now set the variable "item", not "selected".
          This is easier to type, and avoids the misconception that selecting
          a different packet in the tree might change the variable (which it
          doesn't).  The variable "selected" is also set for backward
          compability, though this will be removed in a future release.
        - GUI python consoles will now set item=None if there is
          nothing selected in the packet tree.
        - Simplified the cut/copy/paste behaviour in graphical Python consoles.
        - The knot/link census is now explicitly called the *hyperbolic*
          knot/link census, since non-hyperbolic knots or links are excluded.
    DOCUMENTATION:
        - Layout and navigation improvements in the user handbook.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added several tests related to Hakenness testing.

Version 4.92  [ 12 April, 2012 ] - The "hello Windows!" release.

    INSTALLATION:
        - Regina now builds and runs under Windows!
        - MacOS users now have a drag-and-drop app bundle, and do not
          need fink at runtime.
        - Linux (and indeed all) users no longer need KDE, since the user
          interface is now Qt-only.
    ENGINE:
        Class NBitmask:
            - Make NBitmask more suitable for use in containers.  Specifically,
              the assignment operator can now be used to initialise an
              uninitialised bitmask or to reset an already-initialised
              bitmask to a different length, and one or both of its
              operands may be invalid.
        Class NBitmask, NBitmask1, NBitmask2:
            - New function lessThan() for lexicographical comparisons.
        Class NDoubleDescription:
            - Removed the inner class LexComp, and replaced it with the new
              global class NPosOrder (see below).  A deprecated typedef
              NDoubleDescription::LexOrder is kept for backward compatibility.
        Class NFacePairing:
            - Function writeDot() can now optionally label graph
              vertices with the corresponding tetrahedron numbers.
            - Added graphviz export routines dot() and dotHeader(), which
              are like writeDot() and writeDotHeader() but return strings
              instead of writing to standard output.
        Class NFacetSpec:
            - New template class that generalises NTetFace to arbitrary
              dimensions.  NTetFace is retained as a convenience typedef,
              but with changes; see the NTetFace notes below.
        Class NGlobalDirs:
            - New routine setDirs() to be used when an application has
              been moved from the cmake-configured installation directory.
        Class NHilbertCD:
            - New class that implements a modified Contejean-Devie algorithm
              for Hilbert basis enumeration, based on the original algorithm in
              "An efficient incremental algorithm for solving systems of
              linear Diophantine equations", Contejean and Devie,
              Inform. and Comput. 113 (1994), 143-172.
        Class NHilbertDual:
            - New class that implements a modified dual algorithm for
              Hilbert basis enumeration, based on the dual algorithm in
              "Normaliz: Algorithms for affine monoids and rational cones",
              W. Bruns and B. Ichim, J. Algebra 324 (2010), 1098-1113.
        Class NHilbertPrimal:
            - New class that enumerates Hilbert bases by decomposing into
              maximal admissible faces and running the primal algorithm from
              Normaliz on each such face.  For details, see
              "Fundamental normal surfaces and the enumeration of Hilbert
              bases", B. Burton, arXiv:1111.7055, November 2011.
        Class NLargeInteger:
            - Made separate constructors and assignment operators for
              arguments of type int, unsigned int, long, and unsigned long.
            - Added ++ and -- operators.
            - Added (long + NLargeInteger) and (long * NLargeInteger) operators.
            - New routines setRaw() and rawData() for interacting directly
              with libgmp and libgmpxx.
        Class NMaxAdmissible:
            - New class for enumerating maximal admissible faces of the
              normal surface solution cone.
        Class NNormalSurface:
            - New routine boundarySlopes() that calculates boundary slopes
              for spun normal surfaces.
            - New routines getOrientedTriangleCoord() and
              getOrientedQuadCoord() for transversely oriented normal surfaces.
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - New routines enumerateFundPrimal() and enumerateFundDual() to
              enumerate fundamental normal surfaces, as well as slower routines
              enumerateFundFullCone() and enumerateFundCD() for comparing
              different enumeration algorithms.
            - New coordinate systems ORIENTED and ORIENTED_QUAD to
              support transverse oriented normal surfaces.
            - New routines beginVectors() and endVectors() and new inner class
              VectorIterator for iterating through raw normal surface vectors.
            - New routine allowsOriented(), indicating whether the underlying
              coordinate system supports transverse orientations.
        Class NNormalSurfaceVector:
            - New routines getOrientedTriangleCoord() and
              getOrientedQuadCoord() for transversely oriented normal surfaces.
            - New routine allowsOriented(), indicating whether the underlying
              coordinate system supports transverse orientations.
        Class NNormalSurfaceVectorOriented, NNormalSurfaceVectorOrientedQuad:
            - New coordinate systems for transversely oriented normal surfaces.
        Class NPacket:
            - Fixed potential crash in fireDestructionEvent().
        Class NPerm3:
            - New routine compareWith() for sorting permutations.
        Class NPerm5:
            - New class describing permutations of five elements.
        Class NPosOrder:
            - Class for sorting hyperplanes during vertex enumeration.
              This is the new name for the old NDoubleDescription::LexComp.
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - New routine slopeEquations() that uses code from SnapPy to
              compute boundary slope matrices for cusps.
            - New routine verifyTriangulation() for ensuring that
              SnapPea has not retriangulated unexpectedly.
        Class NSurfaceSet:
            - New routine allowsOriented(), indicating whether the underlying
              coordinate system supports transverse orientations.
        Class NTetFace:
            - Now an instance of the arbitrary-dimension template class
              NFacetSpec.  NTetFace is retained as a typedef, but the fields
              have been renamed from tet/face to the more general simp/facet.
        Class XMLPropertyDict:
            - Removed the optional defaultVal argument from lookup();
              the default is now always the empty string.
        Routines perm4to5, perm5to4, perm3to4, perm4to3:
            - New routines for converting between permutation classes.
        Routine makeEmbeddedConstraints():
            - Added to help generate admissibility constraints based on a
              flavour constant, instead of an NNormalSurfaceVector subclass.
        Routines writeCSVStandard, writeCSVEdgeWeight:
            - Included boundary slopes of spun-normal surfaces in CSV output.
        Macro REGISTER_FLAVOUR:
            - Now requires an additional argument, indicating whether
              the coordinate system supports transverse orientations.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Ported from KDE to Qt-only.
        - Moved from a single monolithic window to lots of small windows
          (one for the tree, one for each open packets). The old
          interface can be re-enabled through Regina's preferences.
        - Continued the user interface overhaul, again with many more
          improvements that give cleaner and more sensible behaviour
          (too many changes to list individually).
        - Graphical Python consoles now execute "from regina import *"
          automatically.
    UTILITIES:
        regina-python:
            - Now executes "from regina import *" automatically.  You
              can suppress this with the argument --noautoimport.
            - For MacOS users: make sure 32-bit python is called when running
              32-bit fink on a 64-bit machine.
        tricensus:
            - Now outputs all face pairings as it runs, instead of periodic
              snapshots of where the census is up to.

Version 4.91: Internal development version.

Version 4.90  [ 12 September, 2011 ] - First prerelease for version 5.0.

    OVERALL:
        - The graphical user interface has been ported from KDE3 to KDE4.
        - The build system has been ported from autotools to cmake.
        - The built-in portions of the SnapPea kernel have been re-synced
          with the September 2009 version of SnapPea.
    DOCUMENTATION:
        - The users' handbook has undergone a thorough overhaul.  It is
          cleaner, more streamlined, and now full of screenshots.
        - The data file format has been split out of the users' handbook
          and placed in its own separate reference manual.
    ENGINE:
        Typedef AcceptTriangulation:
            - This global typedef has been deprecated.  Please use the
              class typedef NCensus::AcceptTriangulation instead.
        Class BitManipulator, GenericBitManipulator:
            - BitManipulator has new routines firstBit() and lastBit(), which
              return the positions of the first and last true bit respectively.
              This has required the addition of a new non-optimised base class
              GenericBitManipulator, which end users need never use directly.
        Class NAbelianGroup:
            - Routine addRank() now takes a signed integer, so that you
              can subtract from the rank as well as add to it.
            - Two new constructors to compute the homology of a chain complex
              with integer or mod-p coefficients.  Thanks to Ryan Budney.
        Class NAngleStructureList:
            - There is now an option to enumerate only taut angle structures,
              which is significantly faster than enumerating all vertex angle
              structures.  As a result, enumerate() now takes three arguments,
              there is a new routine isTautOnly(), and the data file format
              for angle structure lists contains a new element "angleparams".
            - Renamed allowsStrict() and allowsTaut() to spansStrict() and
              spansTaut().  The old routines are now deprecated but have been
              preserved (for now) for backward compatibility.
        Class NAngleStructureVector:
            - Removed clone().  Just use the copy constructor instead.
        Class NBitmask, NBitmask1, NBitmask2:
            - New operators ^= (XOR), -= (set difference) and = (assignment).
            - New routine truncate(), which truncates a bitmask to a given
              number of bits by setting all subsequent bits to zero.
            - New routines firstBit() and lastBit(), which return the
              positions of the first and last true bit respectively.
            - New convenience typedefs NBitmaskLen8, NBitmaskLen16,
              NBitmaskLen32 and NBitmaskLen64 for fast-and-small bitmasks
              of predetermined sizes.
        Class NCensus:
            - New class typedef NCensus::AcceptTriangulation to replace the
              old global typedef AcceptTriangulation.
        Class NDiscSetTetData:
            - Added assertions in data() to ensure that the given disc
              type and number are valid.  These can be circumvented by
              compiling with -DNDEBUG.
        Class NDoubleDescription:
            - Method enumerateExtremalRays() no longer has the "base" argument
              (which was used for cloning vectors); instead the method takes a
              new template argument specifying a vector class, and new vectors
              are created using the corresponding class constructors.
            - Improved the speed of adjacency testing by using an
              NTrieSet instead of a linear search through all vertices.
              See the NNormalSurfaceList notes below for further information.
            - Method enumerateExtremalRays() now takes an optional argument
              initialRows, allowing the user to force certain hyperplanes
              to be processed first.
        Class NExampleTriangulation:
            - New routine bingsHouse() returning the dual triangulation to
              Bing's house with two rooms.
            - Renamed seifertWeber() to weberSeifert(), for consistency with
              the original paper.  The old routine is now deprecated, but has
              being preserved (for the time being) for backward compatibility.
        Class NFacePairing:
            - Fixed the human-readable output for boundary faces in toString().
              Previously boundary faces were displayed as "n:0"; now they
              are displayed as "bdry".
        Class NFastRay:
            - Merged into the NRay class; see the NRay and NVector changes for
              details.  Because typedefs cannot be templated, there is no
              legacy typedef; instead NFastRay has been removed completely.
        Class NFastVector:
            - Merged into the NVector class; see the NVector changes for
              details.  Because typedefs cannot be templated, there is no
              legacy typedef; instead NFastVector has been removed completely.
        Class NGlobalDirs:
            - New routine data() to return the internal data directory.
        Class NGroupPresentation:
            - Fixed a memory leak in intelligentSimplify().
        Class NIsomorphism:
            - New routine applyInPlace() to directly modify a triangulation.
            - Routine apply() now copies tetrahedron descriptions as
              well as gluings (and so does the new routine applyInPlace()).
        Class NLayeredSurfaceBundle:
            - In isLayeredTorusBundle(), extend the search for possible
              cores to 11 and 12 tetrahedra.
        Class NLargeInteger:
            - New routines randomBoundedByThis(), randomBinary() and
              randomCornerBinary() for pseudo-random number generation.
            - Faster (GMP-native) implementation of swap().
        Class NMarkedAbelianGroup, NHomMarkedAbelianGroup:
            - Both of these classes have much richer interfaces than before,
              and some old routines have now been deprecated.  See the class
              documentation for full details.  Thanks to Ryan Budney.
        Class NMarkedVector:
            - Added swap() to swap the contents of two vectors.
        Class NNormalSurface:
            - New routines isCompressingDisc() and isIncompressible() for
              testing incompressibility.
            - Fixed a memory leak in crush().
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - Sped up enumeration (again), this time by using a
              trie-like structure for adjacency testing.  For the
              Weber-Seifert space this improves speed threefold (roughly).
              Many thanks to Jonathan Shewchuk for encouraging me to
              focus on the adjacency testing bottleneck.
            - New filtering routines filterForLocallyCompatiblePairs() and
              filterForDisjointPairs().
            - New routine filterForPotentiallyIncompressible() to assist with
              bulk incompressibility testing; see arXiv:0909.4625 for details.
            - New routine allowsSpun() to easily identify coordinate systems
              that support spun normal surfaces.
        Class NNormalSurfaceVector:
            - Due to the changes in the NVector hierarchy, clone() is
              now introduced as a virtual function of NNormalSurfaceVector
              (not NVector), and it now returns an NNormalSurfaceVector*.
        Class NPacket:
            - In the python interface, makeOrphan() now returns the packet
              itself and the ownership becomes the responsibility of whoever
              takes this return value.  If nobody takes this return value
              then the packet and its descendants are automatically destroyed.
            - ChangeEventBlock has been renamed to ChangeEventSpan, it
              fires both packetToBeChanged() and packetWasChanged() (on
              construction and destruction respectively), and the
              optional boolean argument is gone (events are now fired always).
              The old class name ChangeEventBlock remains as a
              deprecated typedef for ChangeEventSpan.
            - The protected routine fireChangedEvent() has been removed.  The
              only way to fire a "packet changed" event now is to declare a
              local ChangeEventSpan.
        Class NPacketListener:
            - All events (except for destruction) now come with both future
              and past events: packetToBeChanged() and packetWasChanged(),
              childToBeAdded() and childrenWereAdded(), and so on.
        Class NPerm:
            - Renamed to NPerm4.  The C++ header has also moved from
              triangulation/nperm.h to maths/nperm4.h .  Both the old
              class name and the old header are now deprecated.
            - There are many other changes; see the NPerm4 notes below.
        Class NPerm3:
            - New class describing permutations of three elements.  This
              is extremely fast, using lookup tables for all calculations.
        Class NPerm4:
            - This is the new name for the old class NPerm (see above).
            - New routines S4Index() and orderedS4Index() for reverse
              lookups into the arrays NPerm4::S4 and NPerm4::orderedS4.
            - The constructor that takes an internal permutation code is
              now private, and is replaced by a new static routine
              NPerm4::fromPermCode().  This new routine is easier to
              spot and grep for.
            - The internal permutation codes have changed.  As a result,
              NPerm4 operations are significantly faster.  The old codes
              are now referred to as "first-generation", and the new codes
              are referred to as "second-generation".
            - Routines getPermCode(), setPermCode(), isPermCode() and
              fromPermCode() continue to refer to first-generation codes.
              These old routines are not recommended, since they now incur
              additional overhead.  To replace them, the new (and faster)
              routines getPermCode2(), setPermCode2(), isPermCode2() and
              fromPermCode2() work with second-generation codes instead.
            - The XML data file format continues to use first-generation
              permutation codes (for backward compatibility).
        Class NRational:
            - New STL-compatible routine swap().
        Class NRay:
            - Like the vector hierarchy, NFastRay and NRay are now merged
              into a single NRay class.  The result is that NRay is now
              cleaner and faster, but methods are no longer virtual.
              See the NVector class notes for full details of the changes
              (including important changes in the parent NVector class).
            - Removed the old intersect() function, which was based on
              virtual methods.
        Class NScript:
            - Fixed a bug that lost script variables when reading ancient
              binary files (i.e., files created before Regina 3.0, around
              mid-2002).  This bug only showed up on some compilers.
        Class NSnapPeaCensusManifold, NSnapPeaCensusTri:
            - Routines getHomologyH1() (for both classes) and construct()
              (for NSnapPeaCensusManifold) are now implemented for all SnapPea
              census manifolds/triangulations, not just the smallest few.
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - Kernel messages are now disabled by default.
        Class NSurfaceSet, NSurfaceSubset:
            - New routine allowsSpun() to easily identify coordinate systems
              that support spun normal surfaces.
        Class NTetrahedron:
            - Tetrahedra should now always belong to a triangulation, from
              creation until destruction.  In particular:
              + Tetrahedra should be created by calling
                NTriangulation::newTetrahedron(), which will insert them
                into a triangulation immediately.  There is no need to
                call NTriangulation::addTetrahedron() any more.
              + NTetrahedron::joinTo() now recursively adds adjacent
                tetrahedra to the relevant triangulation (but if you use
                NTriangulation::newTetrahedron() as described above then
                this is fast and changes nothing).
            - Users no longer need to call NTriangulation::gluingsHaveChanged()
              after gluing or ungluing tetrahedron faces; this is now handled
              automatically.
            - The NTetrahedron constructors are now deprecated in favour
              of NTriangulation::newTetrahedron(), as described above.
            - New routine getVertexMapping(), which facilitates a
              consistent orientation around the given vertex for the
              three remaining vertices in each tetrahedron.
            - Added assertions in joinTo() and unjoin() to ensure that
              the preconditions are met.  These can be circumvented by
              compiling with -DNDEBUG.
            - Routines that need the triangulation skeleton (e.g., getVertex(),
              getEdgeMapping(), orientation(), etc.) will now compute the
              skeleton automatically if this has not already been done.
            - New routine getTriangulation() to return the enclosing
              triangulation.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Add new routines newTetrahedron() and
              newTetrahedron(const std::string&).  This is now the
              preferred way of creating tetrahedra (see the NTetrahedron
              notes above).  The old addTetrahedron() is now deprecated.
            - Users no longer need to call gluingsHaveChanged(), which
              is likewise deprecated.  Again, see the NTetrahedron notes above.
            - Routines removeTetrahedron() and removeTetrahedronAt() now
              destroy the tetrahedron immediately and return nothing.
            - New routines hasCompressingDisc() and hasSimpleCompressingDisc()
              to search for compressing discs; see arXiv:0909.4625 for details.
            - The "legality conditions" on closeBook() are now simpler, since
              some of the conditions were automatic consequences of others.
              Practically, nothing has changed (i.e., the new conditions will
              be satisfied if and only if the old conditions were satisfied).
            - The "legality conditions" on twoOneMove() were originally too
              conservative, and are now weaker.  In particular, the endpoints
              of the edge may now both be boundary.  Practically, this means
              that 2-1 moves may now be legal where they were not legal before.
            - New static routine rehydrate() to rehydrate a new triangulation
              from a Callahan-Hildebrand-Weeks dehydration string.  This is a
              more convenient version of insertRehydration().
            - New routines isoSig() and fromIsoSig() for detecting and hashing
              combinatorial isomorphism classes of triangulations.
            - New routines isOriented() and orient() to relabel tetrahedron
              vertices for consistent orientation.  Thanks to Matthias Goerner.
            - New routines isOrdered() and order() to relabel tetrahedron
              vertices so that they are ordered consistently across adjacent
              faces.  Thanks again to Matthias Goerner.
            - New routines swapContents() and moveContentsTo() for
              moving tetrahedra between triangulations.
            - Fixed a memory leak in shellBoundary().
        Class NTrieSet:
            - A new class for storing and querying a large number of sets,
              where the elements of these sets are taken from a small universe.
              The underlying data structure is essentially a trie of bitmasks.
        Class NVector:
            - Streamlined the vector hierarchy by merging NFastVector and
              NVectorDense into a single NVector class, and removing NVectorUnit
              and NVectorMatrix entirely.  The result is that NVector
              is now cleaner and faster, but methods are no longer virtual.
              See the NVector class notes for full details of the changes.
            - Removed the old virtual clone() and makeLinComb() methods.
        Class NVectorDense:
            - Merged into the NVector class; see the NVector changes for
              details.  Because typedefs cannot be templated, there is no
              legacy typedef; instead NFastVector has been removed completely.
        Class NVectorMatrix, NVectorUnit:
            - Removed.  Use NVector instead.
        Class NVertexEmbedding:
            - New routine getVertices(), which facilitates a consistent
              orientation for the three remaining vertices in each tetrahedron.
        Class XMLPropertyDict:
            - The interface for this class is now much more restricted.
              The class now derives from std::map instead of stdhash::hash_map,
              and it allows access to only a few inherited members of std::map.
        Routine metricalSmithNormalForm():
            - New alternative Smith normal form routine that is better for
              working with extremely large matrices.  Thanks to Ryan Budney.
        Routine readIsoSigList():
            - New routine that reads a text file filled with isomorphism
              signatures and returns a container filled with triangulations.
        Routine readSnapPea():
            - Allows additional text on the first line following the
              "% Triangulation" marker (thanks to Matthias Goerner).
        Routine torsionAutInverse():
            - New routine for inverting automorphisms, thanks to Ryan Budney.
        Routines writeCSVStandard(), writeCSVEdgeWeight():
            - Changed the text that is written to the "boundary" field,
              to be consistent with changes to the user interface.
              Possible values are now "spun", "real" or "none".
        File surfaces/flavourregistry.h:
            - The final "pre_test" argument (which is never used) has been
              removed.  As a result, REGISTER_FLAVOUR now takes five arguments,
              not six.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Ported from KDE3 to KDE4.  Finally!
        - The user interface has had a thorough overhaul, and includes
          many usability updates to help new users find their way around.
          Overall, the behaviour is generally cleaner and more sensible.
          A full list of changes is omitted for reasons of space and sanity.
        - There is now an option to enable or disable diagnostic
          messages from the SnapPea kernel.
    UTILITIES:
        tricensus, tricensus-mpi:
            - New option -s to output lists of isomorphism signatures instead
              of the much larger Regina data files.
        tricensus-mpi-status:
            - Now finishes with a running total of all triangulations found.
            - Compressed logs (using gzip or bzip2) are now supported.
              Requires the perl module IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress.
        tricensus-manager:
            - Removed, since tricensus-mpi is a much better alternative.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Some slower but more detailed tests are now optional, and are
          disabled by default.  To switch these tests on, set the
          environment variable REGINA_DETAILED_TESTS to any non-empty value.
        - New tests for file I/O using both modern XML and legacy binary
          file formats.
        - More detailed tests for bitmask operations.
    BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
        - Dropped support for ancient hacks like std::ios::no_create and
          the boost.python make_constructor hack.
        - Iconv is now mandatory, not optional.

Version 4.6  [ 16 May, 2009 ]

    OVERALL:
        - Deprecated everything relating to the non-standard STL/g++ classes
          hash_set and hash_map, for the sake of portability.
        - Added a "deprecation guide" to the website, with a table listing
          the outdated routines/classes/etc. to be removed in Regina 5.0 and
          the corresponding new routines/classes/etc. that replace them.
    ENGINE:
        Class HashPointer, HashString:
            - Deprecated, along with everything else relating to the hash_set
              and hash_map classes.  See the "overall" notes above.
        Class NBoundaryComponent, NComponent, NEdge, NFace, NVertex:
            - All constructors for skeletal objects are now private, since
              only the triangulation skeletal routines should be creating them.
            - Cleaned up some of the more obscure parts of the documentation.
        Class NCensus:
            - Removed findAllCompletions(), which (as the documentation
              points out) is an empty shell of a routine that has never been
              implemented and quite possibly never will.
        Class NDiscType:
            - New class for specifying a normal or almost normal disc type.
        Class NDoubleDescription, NDoubleDescriptor:
            - The old NDoubleDescriptor class has been renamed, and is now
              called NDoubleDescription.  This is merely for consistency
              with documentation and papers; the functionality of the class
              has not changed.  The old name (NDoubleDescriptor) is
              deprecated, but for the time being a typedef is provided
              for backward compatibility.
        Class NEdge:
            - Added new static arrays NEdge::edgeNumber and NEdge::edgeVertex
              to replace the old global arrays regina::edgeNumber,
              regina::edgeStart end regina::edgeEnd.  The old global
              arrays are now deprecated (see below).
            - Added a new static array NEdge::ordering to replace the old
              global routine regina::edgeOrdering().  The old routine is
              now deprecated (see below).
        Class NFace:
            - Added a new static array NFace::ordering to replace the old
              global routine regina::faceOrdering().  The old routine is
              now deprecated (see below).
        Class NFacePairing:
            - Added a missing precondition to isCanonical(), which requires
              that the face pairing be connected.
            - Changed the output format of toString() to make it clearer
              which faces are boundary faces.
        Class NFastRay:
            - New fast but inflexible ray class; this builds on NFastVector
              in the same way that the slower NRay builds on NVector.
        Class NGluingPermSearcher, NCompactSearcher, NClosedPrimeMinSearcher:
            - Overhauled the census code so that some of the optimisations
              used in the closed minimal irreducible / P^2-irreducible census
              can be made available to more general censuses.  In particular,
              the modified union-find for vertex and edge links is now
              available to any census that insists on compact (finite)
              3-manifolds.  For details of these optimisations, see
              "Enumeration of non-orientable 3-manifolds using face-pairing
              graphs and union-find", B. A. Burton, Discrete Comput. Geom. 38
              (2007), no. 3, 527--571.
        Class NIndexedArray:
            - Deprecated, along with everything else relating to the hash_set
              and hash_map classes.  For a replacement, try the NMarkedVector
              class, which is smaller and faster but requires modification
              of the data type being stored.
        Class NIsomorphism, NIsomorphismDirect, NIsomorphismIndexed:
            - NIsomorphism has been enhanced to add all of the functionality
              of the old NIsomorphismDirect class, so NIsomorphism is now a
              fully-fledged isomorphism class in its own right.
            - NIsomorhpismDirect has been deprecated, since this is now an
              empty subclass of NIsomorphism with no extra functionality.
              Programmers can change their code to use NIsomorphism instead.
            - NIsomorphismIndexed has been removed entirely.  Python users
              will not be affected, since this class was never available to
              them.  C++ programmers can now use NIsomorphism in conjunction
              with the NPerm::S4 array instead.
        Class NLargeInteger:
            - The old header utilities/nmpi.h is now deprecated.  Please use
              the new header maths/nlargeinteger.h instead.
        Class NMatrix2:
            - The old header utilities/nmatrix2.h is now deprecated.  Please
              use the new header maths/nmatrix2.h instead.
        Class NNormalSurface:
            - Finally implemented cutAlong()!
            - New routine isEmpty() for identifying empty surfaces.
            - New routine sameSurface() for comparing two normal surfaces.
            - New routines locallyCompatible() and disjoint() for testing
              intersections between normal surfaces.
            - New routine getOctPosition() for locating the non-zero
              octagonal coordinate in an almost normal surface.
            - New routine rawVector() that gives direct read-only access to
              the underlying vector in case this is needed.
            - Removed canCrush() and knownCanCrush(), which are both
              placeholders for routines that have never been implemented.
              The corresponding <cancrush> element has been removed from
              the data file format (though old files that happen to contain
              it will load without problems).
            - Added an optional argument to findVtxOctAlmostNormalSphere()
              that lets the user choose between working in standard and
              quadrilateral-octagon coordinates.
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - Implemented quadrilateral-octagon coordinates for almost normal
              surfaces (the relevant flavour constant is AN_QUAD_OCT).
              See arXiv:0904.3041 for details.
            - Added routines quadToStandard(), standardToQuad(),
              quadOctToStandardAN() and standardANToQuadOct() to convert
              between different solution sets.  See arXiv:0901.2629 for
              details of the underlying algorithms.
            - Changed enumerate() in standard coordinates so that, if
              possible, it enumerates in quadrilateral coordinates first
              and then converts between solution sets (see above).  This
              typically runs orders of magnitude faster.  Similarly for
              standard almost normal coordinates.
            - New routines enumerateStandardDirect() and
              enumerateStandardANDirect() to allow people to circumvent the
              above changes to enumerate() and instead use the old direct
              enumeration from Regina 4.5.1.
            - Almost normal surface enumeration no longer strips out surfaces
              with more than one octagonal *disc* (though it still avoids
              surfaces with more than one octagonal disc *type*).  This
              change is necessary for conversion between quad-oct and
              standard almost normal space, and is also necessary if we
              wish to enumerate *all* almost normal surfaces (as opposed
              to just all *vertex* almost normal surfaces).
            - Added a new coordinate flavour AN_LEGACY to reflect almost
              normal surface lists created with Regina 4.5.1 or earlier,
              where surfaces with more than one octagon were stripped out
              (see above).
        Class NPerm:
            - New routines trunc2() and trunc3() to build a truncated
              version of a permutation string.
            - New arrays NPerm::S4, NPerm::invS4, NPerm::orderedS4,
              NPerm::S3, NPerm::invS3, NPerm::orderedS3, NPerm::S2 and
              NPerm::invS2.  These replace the old (and now deprecated)
              arrays regina::allPermsS4, regina::allPermsS4Inv,
              regina::orderedPermsS4, and so on.
            - Deprecated the setPerm() routines; these are unnecessary
              because NPerm objects are very small and can just be copied
              around using the assignment operator.
        Class NPermItS4:
            - Deprecated, since all this class does is wrap a trivial loop.
              Just loop through the elements of NPerm::S4 directly.
        Class NPillowTwoSphere, NSnappedTwoSphere:
            - Removed reduceTriangulation() and getReducedTriangulation(),
              both of which are empty shells of routines that have never
              been implemented and quite possibly never will.
        Class NRational:
            - Added new routines getTeX() and writeTeX() for TeX-friendly
              output (thanks Ryan!).
            - The old header utilities/nrational.h is now deprecated.  Please
              use the new header maths/nrational.h instead.
        Class NTetrahedron:
            - Renamed getAdjacentTetrahedron(), getAdjacentTetrahedronGluing()
              and getAdjacentFace() to adjacentTetrahedron(), adjacentGluing()
              and adjacentFace(), which should be easier on the fingers.
              The old names are still available for backward compatibility,
              but they are now deprecated and will be removed in Regina 5.0.
            - Proofreading and clarification for some of the older and more
              opaque parts of the documentation.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New routines isBall() and knowsBall() for recognising the
              3-dimensional ball.
            - New elementary move closeBook().
            - Completely overhauled collapseEdge().  The eligiblity checks for
              this routine are now correct and not overly conservative, which
              makes this routine both useful and safe.  The big warning is
              now gone from the collapseEdge() documentation as a result.
            - Routine simplifyToLocalMinimum() now collapses edges, which
              makes a big difference for multiple-vertex triangulations.
            - Routine intelligentSimplify() now uses book opening moves to
              create new opportunities for collapsing edges (which makes a
              big difference for bounded triangulations), and also uses
              book closing moves to reduce the number of boundary faces
              once nothing else can be done.
            - Routine isThreeSphere() now works in quadrilateral-octagon
              coordinates instead of standard almost normal coordinates.
              See arXiv:0904.3041 for details.
            - Removed crushMaximalForest(), which (as the documentation has
              pointed out since the first release) has never worked properly,
              and which is therefore never actually used.
            - Fixed crashes in twoOneMove(), twoZeroMove(NVertex*, ...)
              and shellBoundary().  These crashes were triggered by certain
              types of non-minimal triangulations with boundary.
            - Fixed a couple of nasty bugs in shellBoundary(), which had the
              potential to give incorrect results when simplifying
              triangulations with boundary.
            - Fixed bugs in several simplification routines when working
              with invalid triangulations; these sometimes "simplified"
              invalid edges to become valid edges.
            - New routine reorderTetrahedraBFS() for renumbering tetrahedra
              in a more sensible fashion.
            - Routines isZeroEfficient() and hasSplittingSurface() now
              operate on a clone of the triangulation, to avoid triggering
              changes to the packet tree.
        Routine edgeOrdering(), faceOrdering():
            - Deprecated these routines, in favour of the new NEdge::ordering[]
              and NFace::ordering[] lookup tables.
        Routine edgeDescription(), faceDescription():
            - Deprecated these routines, in favour of the new NPerm::trunc2()
              and NPerm::trunc3() routines.
        Routine writeResUsage():
            - New helper routine to assist with diagnostics and measurements
              of performance.
        Global arrays allPermsS4, allPermsS4Inv, orderedPermsS4, allPermsS3,
                allPermsS3Inv, orderedPermsS3, allPermsS2, allPermsS2Inv:
            - All of these arrays are now deprecated.  Please use the new
              arrays NPerm::S4, NPerm::invS4, NPerm::orderedS4, and so on.
        Global arrays edgeNumber, edgeStart, edgeEnd:
            - Deprecated; users are advised to switch to the new arrays
              NEdge::edgeNumber and NEdge::edgeVertex instead.
        Namespace stdhash:
            - Deprecated, along with everything else relating to the hash_set
              and hash_map classes.  See the "overall" notes above.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - The elementary moves dialog now has additional "Close book"
          and "Collapse edge" options.
        - Items in the triangulation composition list can now be copied
          into the clipboard via the right mouse button.  Amongst other
          things, this makes extracting the dehydration string much simpler.
        - In the triangulation viewer, the Surfaces panel now has a new
          "3-ball?" entry beneath the current "3-sphere?" entry.
        - The normal surface list viewer now has two additional tabs: one to
          summarise all surfaces in the list (which is now the default tab),
          and one to list pairwise compatibilities between surfaces.
        - The normal surface list viewer now has an additional "Cut Along"
          menu item.  The shortcut letter for "Crush" has changed as well.
        - Warn the user before enumerating immersed and/or singular normal
          surfaces, in case the "embedded surfaces only" box was unchecked
          by accident.  Moreover, refuse to enumerate immersed and/or
          singular *almost* normal surfaces, since this feature was designed
          for use with normal surfaces only.
        - The surface coordinate viewer now lists the location of the almost
          normal disc(s) alongside the other high-level surface properties.
        - Normal surfaces are now individually numbered within surface lists,
          which should make it easier to keep track of which is which.
        - Added "Troubleshooting" and "Handbook won't open?" entries to
          the Help menu, to make it easier to find solutions if things break.
        - The "Python Reference" entry in the Help menu should now work
          even when konqueror is not installed.
        - Fixed a bug whereby small triangulations occasionally became
          read-only after a user visited the Surfaces panel.
        - Added a scrollbar to the Cellular Info pane in case the window
          is small.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added very thorough tests for NPerm.
        - Additional tests for triangulation simplification and Euler
          characteristic.
        - New tests for the recognition of families of standard triangulations
          and manifolds.
        - New tests that enumerate automorphisms of triangulations and
          test for subcomplexes.
        - Added exhaustive testing for 3-sphere and 3-ball recognition.
        - Added exhaustive testing for conversions between normal surface
          solution sets in different coordinate systems.
    BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
        - Installing into a staging area (i.e., building packages) now works
          fine even if older versions of the Regina development libraries are
          installed (this used to cause relinking problems on some systems).

Version 4.5.1  [ 28 October, 2008 ]

    CENSUS:
        - Replaced the old plain-text Notation packets with detailed PDF
          packets in the closed orientable / non-orientable censuses.
          These new Notation packets explain the manifold names and
          parameters precisely, and include supporting diagrams.
        - Renamed some census manifolds to avoid arbitrary (a), (b) suffixes.
          In the 11-tetrahedron closed orientable census:
            Hyp_2.13401634 (Z_14) (a)  ->  Hyp_2.13401634 (Z_14, geod = 0.4606)
            Hyp_2.13401634 (Z_14) (b)  ->  Hyp_2.13401634 (Z_14, geod = 0.3684)
            (These have also been reordered in the overall list of manifolds.)
          In the 11-tetrahedron closed non-orientable census:
            SFS [M] U m003 (a)  ->  SFS [M] U m003 (Z + Z_5)
            SFS [M] U m003 (b)  ->  SFS [M] U m003 (Z + Z_10)
          These changes are only stop-gaps until hyperbolic manfiolds are
          dealt with properly (i.e., expect the names to change again).
    ENGINE:
        Class NBitmask, NBitmask1, NBitmask2, BitManipulator:
            - New classes for manipulating bitmasks.  NBitmask is for bitmasks
              of arbitrary length, whereas NBitmask1 and NBitmask2 are
              optimised for situations where the length is known to be small.
              BitManipulator makes it easier to offer optimised template
              specialisations.
        Class NCompConstraint, NCompConstraintSet:
            - Removed.  Compatibility constraints now refer to facets of
              the original cone, not coordinate positions (hence the
              rename, since the semantics have changed in a fundamental way).
              Individual compatibility constraints are now straight sets of
              integers, and the deque-based NCompConstraintSet has been
              replaced with the new vector-based class NEnumConstraintList.
        Class NDoubleDescriptor:
            - Streamlined the vertex enumeration routine, which is now
              much, much faster.  See arXiv:0808.4050 for a full list of
              improvements.
            - The vertex enumeration routine now takes its arguments in
              a different form, and more importantly now insists that
              the original cone is in fact the non-negative orthant.
              To ensure that python/C++ users notice that things have changed,
              this routine has been renamed from enumerateVertices() to
              enumerateExtremalRays().
            - Major overhaul of the documentation, which is now (hopefully)
              much clearer.
        Class NEnumConstraintList:
            - Added to replace the old NCompConstraintSet class.  See
              the notes above on NCompConstraintSet for details.
        Class NFastVector:
            - New vector class that is less flexible than NVector but
              more streamlined, largely because it has no virtual functions.
        Class NGraphTriple:
            - Fixed a bug in writeTeXName() that listed incorrect entries for
              the first matrix.  This does not affect any census data that
              has been published or shipped with earlier versions of Regina.
        Class NLargeInteger:
            - Fixed lcm() to do the right thing in the case of lcm(0,0).
        Class NMatrixInt:
            - New integer-specific routines divRowExact(), divColExact(),
              gcdRow(), gcdCol(), reduceRow() and reduceCol().
        Class NMatrixField:
            - Removed this class, since it is never used and since it does not
              actively address the accuracy problems raised by real numbers.
        Class NNormalSurfaceVector:
            - Removed createNonNegativeCone() from subclasses (which is
              no longer required after the vertex enumeration overhaul),
              and added makeZeroVector() (which is now required).
        Class NPDF:
            - A new packet type that allows PDF documents to be stored
              directly as packets inside Regina data files.
        Routines base64Length(), isBase64(), base64Encode(), base64Decode():
            - New routines for base64 encoding and decoding, taken and
              modified from the gnulib library.
        Routines createNonNegativeCone(), makeZeroVector():
            - Removed global routine createNonNegativeCone() and replaced it
              with the new global makeZeroVector(), in line with the changes
              to NNormalSurfaceVector listed above.
        Routine gcd():
            - Now takes longs instead of unsigned longs, and guarantees
              that the gcd returned will be non-negative.
        Routine lcm():
            - Added to the collection of basic number theory routines.
        Routines readPDF(), writePDF():
            - New routines for importing and exporting PDF packets to
              real PDF files.
        Routines rowBasis(), rowBasisAndOrthComp():
            - Added to find the rank of an integer matrix and bases for its
              row space and orthogonal complement.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - PDF documents can now be embedded within data files as PDF packets.
          Added import, export and creation facilities, plus a PDF packet
          viewer that uses either an embedded KPart (such as kpdf or
          kghostview's embedded viewer) or an external application (such
          as xpdf or evince) according to the user's preferences.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added new tests for normal surfaces that exploit generic properties
          of layered loops; these tests push to 50 tetrahedra, and can
          easily be extended further as surface enumeration becomes faster.
        - Added additional tests for normal surfaces and angle strutures
          that compare solutions coordinate by coordinate (instead of
          counting solutions and looking for large-scale properties).

Version 4.5  [ 17 May, 2008 ]

    OVERALL:
        - Regina finally pays attention to character encodings:
            + All strings in the calculation engine are assumed to be UTF-8,
              except for filenames which should be in whatever local encoding
              the operating system expects.
            + Regina's XML data files store their data in UTF-8, as does the
              python configuration file ~/.regina-libs.
            + The various user interfaces ensure that the correct character
              encodings are always used, and translate between encodings
              where required.
            + Users who pass strings directly to the calculation engine
              (through the python or C++ interface) must ensure that
              their strings are either UTF-8 or just plain ASCII.
        - Builds under gcc 4.3.
        - Supports building out-of-tree (e.g., making separate builds in
          debug/ and release/ subdirectories).
    ENGINE:
        Class Locale, IConvBuffer, IConvStream:
            - New classes in the regina::i18n namespace for working with
              internationalisation and character encodings.
        Class NExampleTriangulation:
            - New routine seifertWeber() to build the Seifert-Weber
              dodecahedral space.
        Class NFileInfo:
            - Made the XML identification routines more robust, so that
              they work even if extra parameters (such as encoding or
              standalone declarations) are present in the XML prologue.
        Class NGlobalDirs:
            - New class for easy access to system installation directories
              for various components of Regina.
        Class NMarkedVector, NMarkedElement:
            - New class for a vector with fast reverse lookups.  This
              is more memory efficient than NIndexedArray, but requires
              modifications to the data type being stored.
        Class NPacket, NPacketListener:
            - Fires packetWasRenamed() when packet tags are added or removed.
              Note that packet tags still cannot be accessed through the GUI
              except for via the python bindings.
            - Made the event handling code more robust; this fixes a
              couple of crashes in the GUI that occured when packets were
              deleted from the tree while they were still in use elsewhere.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Streamlined the implementation, cutting ~ 1/3 of the memory
              usage and improving speed also.  As a result:
                + Tetrahedra and skeletal components are now stored using
                  NMarkedVector, not NIndexedArray.  As a result the return
                  types of getTetrahedra(), getVertices(), etc. have changed.
                + The old reverse lookup routines getTetrahedronIndex(),
                  getVertexIndex(), etc. are now deprecated.  The new routines
                  tetrahedronIndex(), vertexIndex(), etc. are even faster,
                  but have new preconditions requiring the given tetrahedron,
                  vertex, etc. to belong to the triangulation.
        Class NXMLElementReader:
            - New routine usingParser() that passes the current parser to the
              top-level element reader.
        Class XMLParserCallback:
            - Callback routine start_document() now takes a single argument
              that points to the current XMLParser.
        Routine readXMLFile(), readFileMagic():
            - Assumes that any Regina data files created by version 4.4 or
              earlier use a LATIN-1 encoding (which is what the old GUI used
              by default), and that any data files created by version 4.5 or
              later use UTF-8.
        Routine versionUsesUTF8():
            - Added to assist code that works with files on a low-level basis.
        Routines writeCSVStandard(), writeCSVEdgeWeight():
            - New routines for exporting normal surface lists to plain-text
              CSV files (which can then be imported into a spreadsheet or
              database).
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Normal surface lists can now be exported to plain-text CSV files
          (which can then be imported into a spreadsheet or database).
        - The default SnapPea filename filter is now *.tri instead of just *.
        - Several imports and exports (e.g., to/from python scripts and C++
          source) now allow the user to select an explicit character encoding.
        - Added the Seifert-Weber dodecahedral space to the list of example
          triangulations that can be created.
        - When adding a new library in Regina's python settings, the file
          dialog now opens in the pylib/ directory where sample libraries
          are installed.
        - Application icons are now listed under hicolor instead of crystalsvg,
          which should make them easier for other desktop environments to find.
    PYTHON:
        - Use docstrings for the helper routines in pylib/, so documentation
          for these routines can be accessed from within python at runtime.
        - Added loadCensus.py as a new collection of optional helper routines
          in pylib/.  These make it easy to load census data files from within
          python.
    UTILITIES:
        regfiledump, trisetcmp:
            - Now respects the default locale; any international characters
              in packet labels or packet contents are displayed using the
              correct character set (e.g., LATIN-1 for Western European users).

Version 4.4  [ 25 November, 2007 ] - The "hug a Mac today" release.

    OVERALL:
        - Builds and runs happily on MacOS!  Requires Fink to be installed.
        - Tidied up the directory hierarchy a little.  The old engine/engine/
          is now just engine/, and the old engine/doc-files/ is now
          engine/doxygen/.
        - Thanks to Ryan Budney for his many contributions to this release!
    CENSUS:
        - Expanded the closed non-orientable census to 11 tetrahedra.
        - Expanded the closed orientable census to 11 tetrahedra, and
          split it into three data files.  The 9-tetrahedron and
          10-tetrahedron files are shipped with Regina as before (as
          closed-or-census.rga and closed-or-census-large.rga); the
          11-tetrahedron file is extremely large and must be downloaded
          separately from the Regina website.
        - Modified the closed orientable census files to use more
          consistent choices of monodromy matrices for torus bundles.
        - Clarified the matrix notation used with graph manifolds.
    ENGINE:
        Class NClosedPrimeMinSearcher:
            - Census generation is much faster for larger numbers of
              tetrahedra, due to new tests for high-genus vertex links.
            - Also made census generation more efficient by pruning on
              high-degree edges (as well as the usual low-degree edges).
        Class NDoubleDescriptor:
            - Now a standalone class, since the base NVertexEnumerator
              has been removed.
            - Made all member functions static.  Objects of this class
              can no longer be created.
        Class NFacePairing:
            - Modified writeDot() to behave well with ancient versions
              of Graphviz.
        Class NHomologicalData:
            - New class for computing all sorts of detailed homological
              information for a manifold; thanks to Ryan Budney for this.
        Class NLargeInteger:
            - New routine divisionAlg() for using the division algorithm.
            - New routine legendre() for calculating Legendre symbols.
        Class NMatrix:
            - New == and != operators for element-by-element comparison.
        Class NMatrixInt:
            - Added a set() routine to the python interface for setting
              matrix elements (which was previously not possible in python).
            - Made matrix multiplication available in the python interface.
            - Added a python-only variant of initialise() that fills a
              matrix given a complete list of elements.
        Class NMatrixRing:
            - New routine det() for fast calculation of matrix determinants.
            - New convenience routine isIdentity().
            - Changed the return type of operator * from a raw pointer to a
              std::auto_ptr, to make it easier to multiply matrices inside
              temporary expressions.
            - Added a new multiplyAs() template routine that multiplies but
              (unlike operator *) returns a subclass of NMatrixRing.
        Class NMarkedAbelianGroup, NHomMarkedAbelianGroup:
            - New classes for working with groups defined by chain
              complexes; thanks to Ryan Budney for these.
        Class NPacket:
            - New routine reparent() to simplify ownership issues when
              using Python scripting.
        Class NPerm:
            - Micro-optimised routines that are called extremely frequently,
              such as sign().
        Class NPrimes:
            - New class that provides a more sophisticated infrastructure
              for prime factorisation than the old factorise() and
              primesUpTo() routines.
        Class NRational:
            - New routine abs() for calculating absolute value.
            - New routine doubleApprox() for converting to a real number.
        Struct NSatAnnulus:
            - New routine attachLST() to help with Seifert fibred spaces.
        Class NSFSpace:
            - Updated reduce() to make the best possible decisions on
              whether to reflect all fibres in cases where this is
              possible (previously it made faster decisions but
              occasionally missed some more subtle reductions).
            - Enhanced construct() to support the triangulation of all
              Seifert fibred spaces over the 2-sphere without punctures
              or reflector boundaries.
        Class NTetrahedron:
            - New routine orientation() for tracking orientation.
        Class NTorusBundle:
            - Greatly improved monodromy matrix reduction, to the point
              where equivalent torus bundles should give equal matrices.
            - Fixed a bug in the matrix reduction for non-symmetric
              matrices in non-orientable manifolds (sometimes the
              transpose matrix was obtained instead of the correct matrix).
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New routine layerOn() for performing layerings.
            - New routine dehydrate() for extracting Callahan-Hildebrand-Weeks
              dehydration strings.
            - Optimised the skeletal calculations, which now run *much* faster.
            - Renamed getEulerCharacteristic() to getEulerCharTri(), since for
              ideal triangulations this differs from the Euler characteristic
              of the corresponding compact manifold.  The old name is kept as
              an alias but is now deprecated.
            - Added a new routine getEulerCharManifold(), which *does* calculate
              the Euler characteristic of the corresponding compact manifold.
            - Fixed a crash in splitIntoComponents() that occurred when
              the triangulation skeleton had not yet been calculated.
        Class NVertexEnumerator:
            - Removed.  This abstract class existed to support multiple
              vertex enumeration algorithms, but in reality we're only
              using double descriptor anyway.  The virtual template
              member functions caused problems with g++-4.2, which was
              the final push.  NDoubleDescriptor is now a standalone class.
        Routine smithNormalForm():
            - New five-argument version that not only calculates the Smith
              normal form but also returns appropriate change of basis
              matrices; thanks to Ryan Budney.
        Routines columnEchelonForm() and preImageOfLattice():
            - New routines for working with matrices and homomorphisms;
              thanks again to Ryan Bydney.
        Routines factorise(), primesUpTo():
            - Deprecated in favour of routines from the new NPrimes class.
        Routine clonePtr():
            - New routine to assist copy constructors for classes that
              compute data on demand.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - New Algebra -> Cellular Info tab containing a variety of new
          homological data for triangulations; thanks to Ryan Budney.
        - Graphs now look better when drawn using an old Graphviz 1.x
          (previously the graphs were only tested under Graphviz 2.x).
        - Better infrastructure for determining the status of the
          current Graphviz installation.  For version 1.x, Regina now
          insists on using dot, since the old neato 1.x cannot handle
          multiple edges.
        - Removed the Crush column from normal surface lists, since it has
          never contained any information beyond "N/A" or "Unknown".
        - The Regina reference manual is now called the Regina handbook,
          for consistency with other KDE applications.
    PYTHON:
        - The regina-python tool has new options -i/--interactive (run a
          script and leave the interpreter open) and -n/--nolibs (do not
          load any of the normal user libraries).
    UTILITIES:
        trisetcmp:
            - Now outputs more appropriate messages when subcomplex testing
              (previously the same messages were used for both subcomplex
              testing and isomorphism testing).
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added a new test suite for python bindings, in addition to the
          usual C++ test suite that is already present.
        - Added tests for the NPerm class.
        - Added tests for vertex link calculations.
        - Added tests for the orientable double cover of a triangulation.
        - Added tests for the new NPrimes class.
        - Added division algorithm tests for NLargeInteger.
        - Added tests for the new NHomologicalData class.
        - Added tests for triangulation dehydrations and rehydrations.
        - Initial work on tests for the NRational class.
    BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
        - Updated libtool from version 1.5a to 1.5.22 with Debian patches
          (required for MacOS support).

Version 4.3.1  [ 5 May, 2006 ]

    ENGINE:
        Class NClosedPrimeMinSearcher:
            - Improved speed by adding additional face pairing graph
              tests; see math.GT/0604584 for details.
            - Made a very slight improvement in speed by testing for
              extremely high degree edges.
            - Fixed memory leak (the destructor was not deallocating some
              internal arrays).
            - Minor changes to the behaviour of mergeEdgeClasses()
              (might return only some flags instead of all flags).
        Class NFacePairing:
            - New constructor for building the face pairing of an
              existing triangulation.
            - New routines hasOneEndedChainWithStrayBigon() and
              hasTripleOneEndedChain() for testing for more types of
              graphs that cannot appear in a closed census.
            - New routines hasSingleStar(), hasDoubleStar() and
              hasDoubleSquare() for investigating larger face pairing graphs.
            - New routines writeDot() and writeDotHeader() to assist
              with graph visualisation.
        Routine readOrb():
            - New routine for importing Orb / Casson triangulations;
              thanks to Ryan Budney for contributing this import filter.
        Routine readSnapPea():
            - Verifies that the first line of the file is "% Triangulation",
              instead of simply testing for the '%' and ignoring the rest.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Now displays face pairing graphs in the triangulation viewer, using
          Graphviz for the rendering (see the Skeleton tab).  This required
          splitting the main Skeleton tab into two smaller child tabs.
        - New configuration options for the Graphviz executable and the
          default Skeleton child tab.
        - No longer crashes when attempting to clone the root packet
          (it simply displays an error message instead).
        - Added a workaround for the icon problems that arise when using
          GNU/Linux distributions with buggy icon themes.
        - Added 48x48 and 64x64 icons for Regina and its data files.
    TEST SUITE:
        - New tests for recognising bad and otherwise interesting subgraphs
          within face pairing graphs.

Version 4.3  [ 27 March, 2006 ]

    OVERALL:
        - Expanded the closed non-orientable census to 10 tetrahedra.
        - Expanded the closed orientable census to 10 tetrahedra, and
          split it into two data files (large and small).
        - Updated postal address for the Free Software Foundation.
        - Bibliographic updates for the reference manual.
        - Fixed some harmless compiler warnings, and tightened syntax
          to adhere to the requirements of gcc 4.1.
    ENGINE:
        Class LessDeref:
            - New utility class for working with pointers in the Standard
              Template Library.
        Class NGluingPerms, NGluingPermSearcher, NClosedPrimeMinSearcher:
            - Significant overhaul.
            - Moved gluing permutation search routines into new classes
              NGluingPermSearcher and NClosedPrimeMinSearcher.
            - Supports partial depth-based searching (by passing a
              non-negative depth parameter to the new runSearch() routine).
            - Tracks both vertex and edge links using a modified union
              find structure to prune more braches of the search tree
              where possible.  This makes an incredible difference to the
              census running time.  Pruning takes place on non-orientable
              vertex links, too many or too few vertices or edges, low
              degree or invalid edges, conical faces, and L(3,1) spines.
        Class NGraphLoop, NGraphPair, NGraphTriple:
            - New families of graph manifolds.
        Class NKnot:
            - Removed this unwritten placeholder class.
        Class NLayering:
            - New class to help follow through layerings of tetrahedra
              within a triangulation.
        Class NLayeredSolidTorus:
            - New routine formsLayeredSolidTorusTop() for finding an LST
              from the top end instead of the bottom.
            - New routine transform() for following through an isomorphism.
        Class NLayeredTorusBundle, NTxICore, NTxIDiagonalCore, NTxIParallelCore:
            - Added for recognition of layered surface bundles.
        Class NListOnCall:
            - New class for expensive and rarely used hard-coded lists.
        Class NManifold:
            - Routine writeTeXName() no longer provides wrapping dollar signs.
            - New operator < for ordering manifolds deterministically.
        Class NMatrix2:
            - New specialised class for working with 2-by-2 integer matrices.
        Class NPacket, NPacketListener:
            - New NPacket routine sortChildren().
            - Packet listeners are now unregistered immediately *before*
              packetToBeDestroyed() is called.  This avoids unpleasantries
              when a listener tries to unregister itself during this call.
        Class NPerm:
            - The assignment operator now returns a reference instead of void.
        Class NSatAnnulus, NSatBlock, NSatRegion, NBlockedSFS, NBlockedSFSLoop,
                  NBlockedSFSPair, NBlockedSFSTriple, NPluggedTorusBundle,
                  plus subclasses and other support structures:
            - New classes for recognising and describing Seifert fibred spaces
              and other graph manifolds that are built using saturated blocks.
        Class NSFS, NExceptionalFibre:
            - Removed; see below.
        Class NSFSpace, NSFSFibre:
            - Complete overhaul of the Seifert fibred space classes.
            - Now more general, supporting both orientable and
              non-orientable 3-manifolds as well as base orbifolds with
              reflector boundary components.
            - Classes have been renamed from the old NSFS / NExceptionalFibre
              to make it clear that large-scale changes have taken place.
        Class NSFSAltSet:
            - New class for finding alternative simple representations of
              the same bounded Seifert fibred space.
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - Added a boolean argument to the constructor that permits the
              SnapPea kernel to work with closed triangulations if the user
              really wants to allow it.
        Class NStandardTri:
            - Routine writeTeXName() no longer provides wrapping dollar signs.
        Class NTorusBundle:
            - New class of 3-manifolds describing torus bundles over the
              circle.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Combined isomorphism and subcomplex testing routines into
              a single all-in-one routine to avoid excessive code reuse.
            - Added new subcomplex testing routine findAllSubcomplexesIn(),
              in which all matches (not just the first) are returned.
            - Routines getTetrahedronIndex(), getComponentIndex(),
              getBoundaryComponentIndex(), getFaceIndex(), getEdgeIndex()
              and getVertexIndex() now returned signed instead of unsigned
              longs, so that -1 can be returned if the object could not
              be found.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Added a configuration option that allows the SnapPea kernel to
          work with closed triangulations.
        - Fixed the crash when deleting a triangulation that is currently the
          target of an isomorphism/subcomplex test.
        - Fixed a crash that sometimes occurs in large files when deleting
          a triangulation that is currently being viewed.
        - Fixed extremely slow updates in the triangulation composition tab
          for very large data files.
        - Text and script packets now open with the cursor at the top
          instead of the bottom.
    PYTHON:
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - Offers the additional zero-argument routine volumeWithPrecision()
              as a way of returning the precision of the volume calculation.
    UTILITIES:

            - Significant overhaul.
            - Now supports finer-grained subsearches via --depth.
            - Better logging.
            - Only writes .rga data files for cases in which at least
              one triangulation was found.
            - New option --dryrun for a quick overview of the search space.
        tricensus-mpi-status:
            - New tool for parsing tricensus-mpi logs.
        trisetcmp:
            - Support subcomplex testing as well as isomorphism testing.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Don't enforce precision limits for degenerate snappea volume
          testing, to allow for flexibility in floating point behaviours
          of different chipsets.
        - Added tests for NIsomorphism.

Version 4.2.1  [ 18 September, 2005 ]

    OVERALL:
        - Added a chapter on imports and exports to the reference manual.
        - Expanded the closed non-orientable census to eight tetrahedra.
    ENGINE:
        Overall structure:
            - Fixed "regina-engine-config --cflags", which wrote includes
              for Regina's dependencies but not for Regina itself (sigh).
        Class NIsomorphism:
            - New routine random() for generating random isomorphisms.

          has boundary faces.
    UTILITIES:
        trisetcmp:
            - New utility for comparing two different sets of triangulations.

Version 4.2  [ 7 July, 2005 ]

    ENGINE:
        Overall structure:
            - Included portions of the SnapPea kernel!  Thanks again to
              Jeff Weeks for his support.
            - Added a regina-engine-config script to make it easier to
              build Regina's calculation engine into other applications.
        Class NExampleTriangulation:
            - Added to facilitate construction of several different
              ready-made sample triangulations.
        Class NFacePairing:
            - New routine hasWedgedDoubleEndedChain.
        Class NLayeredSolidTorus:
            - New routine isLayeredSolidTorus for classifying an entire
              triangulation component.
        Class NPacketListener:
            - Added an extra boolean argument to childWasRemoved() to indicate
              the situation in which the parent is also being destroyed.
        Class NSnapPeaCensusManifold, NSnapPeaCensusTri:
            - Added to aid recognition of very small SnapPea census
              triangulations.
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - Added to give Regina triangulations access to the SnapPea kernel.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New routine finiteToIdeal() for extending a triangulation.
            - New routines insertConstruction() and dumpConstruction() to
              make it easier to hard-code triangulations in source code.
            - Fixed vertex link calculations, which were previously
              incorrect if a triangulation contained invalid edges.
            - Fixed bug in twoZeroMove() which caused a crash in some cases
              involving triangulations with boundary.
        Class NTrivialTri:
            - Added recognition of one-tetrahedron balls.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Include several example triangulations in the triangulation
          creation dialog.
        - Allow exporting a triangulation to C++ source.
        - Renamed "Ideal to Finite" as "Truncate Ideal Vertices" in the menu.
        - Include a padlock in the corner of a packet icon if the packet
          is uneditable.
        - Tighter thread safety in the GUI.  This is required because some
          calculations (such as surface enumeration) run in a separate thread.
        - Worked around a Qt bug that caused a crash when pressing a key in
          a table of normal surfaces or matching equations.
        - Fixed a bug in which GAP output was unparseable due to GAP
          inserting spaces where Regina was not expecting them.
    UTILITIES:
        tricensus-mpi:
            - New census manager for use on MPI-enabled clusters.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added tests for SnapPea calculations.
        - Further additions to the triangulation tests, in particular
          involving invalid and non-standard triangulations.
        - Beginning of a series of tests for elementary moves.
    BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
        - Updated libtool to version 1.5a.  Hopefully this will make
          things better for Darwin/Fink.
        - Requires KDE >= 3.2, so that the XDG applications directory can
          be used for the desktop file.
        - Verifies in the configure script that shared libraries are
          enabled where necessary (i.e., in the KDE and Python interfaces).
        - Better magic in the configure script for finding the correct
          boost.python libraries.
        - Fixed a bug in the configure script whereby -g stripping was
          too agressive, resulting in a compile failure for the python
          interface under some environments.

Version 4.1.3  [ 25 July, 2004 ]

    OVERALL:
        - Included the closed hyperbolic census of Hodgson and Weeks.
        - Made explicit in the reference manual introduction where the
          example files can be found.
    PYTHON:
        - For most objects, == now works like C++ pointer equality
          instead of Python object equality.  That is, it tests whether
          the Python wrappers point to the same C++ object, not whether
          the Python wrappers are in fact the same wrapper.
        - Fixed scripting in the GUI, which was broken with python 2.3
          (indented blocks were treated as complete after just one line).
        - Added a sample python session illustrating progress reporting.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Added an "Open Example" menu item for easy access to the
          sample files.
        - Allow the choice of text editor component to be configured.
        - Several fixes to make Regina work properly with the vimpart,
          including work-arounds for bugs in the vimpart itself.
        - Fixed the massive resource drain while editing a script's
          variable table in a heavily populated data file.
        - Fixed crashes that occured when deleting packets while a
          drop-down packet chooser is in use elsewhere.
        - Tightened up the handling of read-only mode for internal
          components.  Also removed some loopholes that allowed editing
          of uneditable packets.
        - Improved handling of keyboard focus.
        - Changed "Python Reference" to point to the modules index
          instead of the title page.

Version 4.1.2  [ 14 June, 2004 ]
    OVERALL:
        - Updated configure scripts so that the python interface builds
          out of the box on a larger number of platforms (specifically Red Hat
          and Fedora Core are now supported).  Many thanks to Craig Macintyre
          for his patience and assistance with this.
        - More updates to the troubleshooting section; overhauled the
          README.txt and website to hopefully make everything clearer
          and the important information easier to find.
        - Added a suggested form for citing Regina.
        - Updated INSTALL.txt to reflect current --prefix guessing.
    ENGINE:
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Added simplifiedFundamentalGroup() to allow external bodies
              such as GAP to simplify group presentations.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Allow users to simplify fundamental groups using GAP.
        - Added "Education" to the categories for the desktop file, since
          KDE seems adamant about having no separate maths/science menu.
          Anything is better than showing up in Lost & Found. :)
        - Fixed compile error when building against an STL-enabled Qt
          (thanks to Robert Myers for spotting this one).

Version 4.1.1  [ 24 April, 2004 ]
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Fixed compile error when building against Python 2.3.
        - Added "What's This?" button to main/packet window decorations.

Version 4.1  [ 7 March, 2004 ]

        Class NTriangulation:
            - New 0-efficiency / decomposition routines splitIntoComponents(),
              connectedSumDecomposition(), isThreeSphere(), knowsThreeSphere()
              and makeZeroEfficient().
            - New Seifert fibred space constructions insertAugTriSolidTorus()
              and insertSFSOverSphere().
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Actions specific to each packet type now appear in their own
          context-specific menus, i.e., a "Triangulation" menu appears
          when a triangulation is open, etc.
        - Added "Please Wait" dialogs during slow operations.
        - Thorough "What's This?" support and tooltips offered across the
          entire user interface.
        - New tip-of-the-day support.
        - More icons for triangulation actions.
        - Updated the .desktop file and mimetype tests to work correctly
          with KDE 3.2.
    UTILITIES:
        tricensus:
            - Fixed bug in which --genpairs created empty output files.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added tests for connected sum decomposition.

Version 4.0.1  [ 26 January, 2004 ]
    OVERALL:
        - The ./configure script now takes a guess at the correct --prefix,
          runs sanity tests upon it and insists upon Qt >= 3.2.
        - Regina now ships with pregenerated manpages to avoid the need
          for docbook-utils and its complicated dependencies.
        - The troubleshooting section of the reference manual now
          includes compile-time problems and discusses the test suite.
    USER INTERFACE:
        Class GridListViewItem:
            - Added to centralise support for list views with grids.
            - Fixed a compile error with Qt versions 3.1 and earlier.

            - Improved simplification of group presentations.
        Class NNormalSurface:
            - Using NProperty to store calculable properties.
            - Using NTriBool instead of 1/-1/0 for orientability,
              two-sidedness and connectedness.
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - Enumeration routine now takes an optional progress manager
              and can run in a separate thread.
        Class NProgress:
            - Removed isCancellable() since this is not really necessary;
              an operation may simply choose not to poll for cancellation
              requests.
            - Removed isChanged() and made the changed flag protected so
              subclasses can modify it directly.
            - Requires subclasses to adjust the changed flag on all
              public access/update routines.

        Class NLayeredSolidTorus:
            - Added routine flatten() to flatten a layered solid torus
              to a Mobius band.
        Class NMutex::MutexLock:
            - Added reference constructor as well as a pointer constructor.
