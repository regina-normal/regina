Regina - A Normal Surface Theory Calculator

    This file contains specific details of most changes, including
    changes to the API for the calculation engine.

    For general highlights of the changes between releases, see
    HIGHLIGHTS.txt in the same directory as this file.

Version 4.6  [ (under development) ]

    ENGINE:
        Class NEdge:
            - Added new static arrays NEdge::edgeNumber and NEdge::edgeVertex
              to replace the old global arrays regina::edgeNumber,
              regina::edgeStart end regina::edgeEnd.  The old global
              arrays are now deprecated (see below).
        Class NFastRay:
            - New fast but inflexible ray class; this builds on NFastVector
              in the same way that the slower NRay builds on NVector.
        Class NGluingPermSearcher, NCompactSearcher, NClosedPrimeMinSearcher:
            - Overhauled the census code so that some of the optimisations
              used in the closed minimal irreducible / P^2-irreducible census
              can be made available to more general censuses.  In particular,
              the modified union-find for vertex and edge links is now
              available to any census that insists on compact (finite)
              3-manifolds.  For details of these optimisations, see
              "Enumeration of non-orientable 3-manifolds using face-pairing
              graphs and union-find", B. A. Burton, Discrete Comput. Geom. 38
              (2007), no. 3, 527--571.
        Class NNormalSurface:
            - New routine locallyCompatible() for testing intersections
              between normal surfaces.
            - New routine rawVector() that gives direct read-only access to
              the underlying vector in case this is needed.
        Class NPerm:
            - Deprecated the setPerm() routines; these are unnecessary
              because NPerm objects are very small and can just be copied
              around using the assignment operator.
        Class NTetrahedron:
            - Renamed getAdjacentTetrahedron(), getAdjacentTetrahedronGluing()
              and getAdjacentFace() to adjacentTetrahedron(), adjacentGluing()
              and adjacentFace(), which should be somewhat easier on the
              fingers.  The old names are still available for backward
              compatibility, but they are now deprecated and will be removed
              in some future version of Regina.
            - Proofreading and clarification for some of the older and more
              opaque parts of the documentation.
        Routine writeResUsage():
            - New helper routine to assist with diagnostics and measurements
              of performance.
        Global arrays edgeNumber, edgeStart, edgeEnd:
            - Deprecated; users are advised to switch to the new arrays
              NEdge::edgeNumber and NEdge::edgeVertex instead.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Items in the triangulation composition list can now be copied
          into the clipboard via the right mouse button.  Amongst other
          things, this makes extracting the dehydration string much simpler.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added very thorough tests for NPerm.
    BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
        - Installing into a staging area (i.e., building packages) now works
          fine even if older versions of the Regina development libraries are
          installed (this used to cause relinking problems on some systems).

Version 4.5.1  [ 28 October, 2008 ]

    CENSUS:
        - Replaced the old plain-text Notation packets with detailed PDF
          packets in the closed orientable / non-orientable censuses.
          These new Notation packets explain the manifold names and
          parameters precisely, and include supporting diagrams.
        - Renamed some census manifolds to avoid arbitrary (a), (b) suffixes.
          In the 11-tetrahedron closed orientable census:
            Hyp_2.13401634 (Z_14) (a)  ->  Hyp_2.13401634 (Z_14, geod = 0.4606)
            Hyp_2.13401634 (Z_14) (b)  ->  Hyp_2.13401634 (Z_14, geod = 0.3684)
            (These have also been reordered in the overall list of manifolds.)
          In the 11-tetrahedron closed non-orientable census:
            SFS [M] U m003 (a)  ->  SFS [M] U m003 (Z + Z_5)
            SFS [M] U m003 (b)  ->  SFS [M] U m003 (Z + Z_10)
          These changes are only stop-gaps until hyperbolic manfiolds are
          dealt with properly (i.e., expect the names to change again).
    ENGINE:
        Class NBitmask, NBitmask1, NBitmask2, BitManipulator:
            - New classes for manipulating bitmasks.  NBitmask is for bitmasks
              of arbitrary length, whereas NBitmask1 and NBitmask2 are
              optimised for situations where the length is known to be small.
              BitManipulator makes it easier to offer optimised template
              specialisations.
        Class NCompConstraint, NCompConstraintSet:
            - Removed.  Compatibility constraints now refer to facets of
              the original cone, not coordinate positions (hence the
              rename, since the semantics have changed in a fundamental way).
              Individual compatibility constraints are now straight sets of
              integers, and the deque-based NCompConstraintSet has been
              replaced with the new vector-based class NEnumConstraintList.
        Class NDoubleDescriptor:
            - Streamlined the vertex enumeration routine, which is now
              much, much faster.  See arXiv:0808.4050 for a full list of
              improvements.
            - The vertex enumeration routine now takes its arguments in
              a different form, and more importantly now insists that
              the original cone is in fact the non-negative orthant.
              To ensure that python/C++ users notice that things have changed,
              this routine has been renamed from enumerateVertices() to
              enumerateExtremalRays().
            - Major overhaul of the documentation, which is now (hopefully)
              much clearer.
        Class NEnumConstraintList:
            - Added to replace the old NCompConstraintSet class.  See
              the notes above on NCompConstraintSet for details.
        Class NFastVector:
            - New vector class that is less flexible than NVector but
              more streamlined, largely because it has no virtual functions.
        Class NGraphTriple:
            - Fixed a bug in writeTeXName() that listed incorrect entries for
              the first matrix.  This does not affect any census data that
              has been published or shipped with earlier versions of Regina.
        Class NLargeInteger:
            - Fixed lcm() to do the right thing in the case of lcm(0,0).
        Class NMatrixInt:
            - New integer-specific routines divRowExact(), divColExact(),
              gcdRow(), gcdCol(), reduceRow() and reduceCol().
        Class NMatrixField:
            - Removed this class, since it is never used and since it does not
              actively address the accuracy problems raised by real numbers.
        Class NNormalSurfaceVector:
            - Removed createNonNegativeCone() from subclasses (which is
              no longer required after the vertex enumeration overhaul),
              and added makeZeroVector() (which is now required).
        Class NPDF:
            - A new packet type that allows PDF documents to be stored
              directly as packets inside Regina data files.
        Routines base64Length(), isBase64(), base64Encode(), base64Decode():
            - New routines for base64 encoding and decoding, taken and
              modified from the gnulib library.
        Routines createNonNegativeCone(), makeZeroVector():
            - Removed global routine createNonNegativeCone() and replaced it
              with the new global makeZeroVector(), in line with the changes
              to NNormalSurfaceVector listed above.
        Routine gcd():
            - Now takes longs instead of unsigned longs, and guarantees
              that the gcd returned will be non-negative.
        Routine lcm():
            - Added to the collection of basic number theory routines.
        Routines readPDF(), writePDF():
            - New routines for importing and exporting PDF packets to
              real PDF files.
        Routines rowBasis(), rowBasisAndOrthComp():
            - Added to find the rank of an integer matrix and bases for its
              row space and orthogonal complement.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - PDF documents can now be embedded within data files as PDF packets.
          Added import, export and creation facilities, plus a PDF packet
          viewer that uses either an embedded KPart (such as kpdf or
          kghostview's embedded viewer) or an external application (such
          as xpdf or evince) according to the user's preferences.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added new tests for normal surfaces that exploit generic properties
          of layered loops; these tests push to 50 tetrahedra, and can
          easily be extended further as surface enumeration becomes faster.
        - Added additional tests for normal surfaces and angle strutures
          that compare solutions coordinate by coordinate (instead of
          counting solutions and looking for large-scale properties).

Version 4.5  [ 17 May, 2008 ]

    OVERALL:
        - Regina finally pays attention to character encodings:
            + All strings in the calculation engine are assumed to be UTF-8,
              except for filenames which should be in whatever local encoding
              the operating system expects.
            + Regina's XML data files store their data in UTF-8, as does the
              python configuration file ~/.regina-libs.
            + The various user interfaces ensure that the correct character
              encodings are always used, and translate between encodings
              where required.
            + Users who pass strings directly to the calculation engine
              (through the python or C++ interface) must ensure that
              their strings are either UTF-8 or just plain ASCII.
        - Builds under gcc 4.3.
        - Supports building out-of-tree (e.g., making separate builds in
          debug/ and release/ subdirectories).
    ENGINE:
        Class Locale, IConvBuffer, IConvStream:
            - New classes in the regina::i18n namespace for working with
              internationalisation and character encodings.
        Class NExampleTriangulation:
            - New routine seifertWeber() to build the Seifert-Weber
              dodecahedral space.
        Class NFileInfo:
            - Made the XML identification routines more robust, so that
              they work even if extra parameters (such as encoding or
              standalone declarations) are present in the XML prologue.
        Class NGlobalDirs:
            - New class for easy access to system installation directories
              for various components of Regina.
        Class NMarkedVector, NMarkedElement:
            - New class for a vector with fast reverse lookups.  This
              is more memory efficient than NIndexedArray, but requires
              modifications to the data type being stored.
        Class NPacket, NPacketListener:
            - Fires packetWasRenamed() when packet tags are added or removed.
              Note that packet tags still cannot be accessed through the GUI
              except for via the python bindings.
            - Made the event handling code more robust; this fixes a
              couple of crashes in the GUI that occured when packets were
              deleted from the tree while they were still in use elsewhere.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Streamlined the implementation, cutting ~ 1/3 of the memory
              usage and improving speed also.  As a result:
                + Tetrahedra and skeletal components are now stored using
                  NMarkedVector, not NIndexedArray.  As a result the return
                  types of getTetrahedra(), getVertices(), etc. have changed.
                + The old reverse lookup routines getTetrahedronIndex(),
                  getVertexIndex(), etc. are now deprecated.  The new routines
                  tetrahedronIndex(), vertexIndex(), etc. are even faster,
                  but have new preconditions requiring the given tetrahedron,
                  vertex, etc. to belong to the triangulation.
        Class NXMLElementReader:
            - New routine usingParser() that passes the current parser to the
              top-level element reader.
        Class XMLParserCallback:
            - Callback routine start_document() now takes a single argument
              that points to the current XMLParser.
        Routine readXMLFile(), readFileMagic():
            - Assumes that any Regina data files created by version 4.4 or
              earlier use a LATIN-1 encoding (which is what the old GUI used
              by default), and that any data files created by version 4.5 or
              later use UTF-8.
        Routine versionUsesUTF8():
            - Added to assist code that works with files on a low-level basis.
        Routines writeCSVStandard(), writeCSVEdgeWeight():
            - New routines for exporting normal surface lists to plain-text
              CSV files (which can then be imported into a spreadsheet or
              database).
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Normal surface lists can now be exported to plain-text CSV files
          (which can then be imported into a spreadsheet or database).
        - The default SnapPea filename filter is now *.tri instead of just *.
        - Several imports and exports (e.g., to/from python scripts and C++
          source) now allow the user to select an explicit character encoding.
        - Added the Seifert-Weber dodecahedral space to the list of example
          triangulations that can be created.
        - When adding a new library in Regina's python settings, the file
          dialog now opens in the pylib/ directory where sample libraries
          are installed.
        - Application icons are now listed under hicolor instead of crystalsvg,
          which should make them easier for other desktop environments to find.
    PYTHON:
        - Use docstrings for the helper routines in pylib/, so documentation
          for these routines can be accessed from within python at runtime.
        - Added loadCensus.py as a new collection of optional helper routines
          in pylib/.  These make it easy to load census data files from within
          python.
    UTILITIES:
        regfiledump, trisetcmp:
            - Now respects the default locale; any international characters
              in packet labels or packet contents are displayed using the
              correct character set (e.g., LATIN-1 for Western European users).

Version 4.4  [ 25 November, 2007 ] - The "hug a Mac today" release.

    OVERALL:
        - Builds and runs happily on MacOS!  Requires Fink to be installed.
        - Tidied up the directory hierarchy a little.  The old engine/engine/
          is now just engine/, and the old engine/doc-files/ is now
          engine/doxygen/.
        - Thanks to Ryan Budney for his many contributions to this release!
    CENSUS:
        - Expanded the closed non-orientable census to 11 tetrahedra.
        - Expanded the closed orientable census to 11 tetrahedra, and
          split it into three data files.  The 9-tetrahedron and
          10-tetrahedron files are shipped with Regina as before (as
          closed-or-census.rga and closed-or-census-large.rga); the
          11-tetrahedron file is extremely large and must be downloaded
          separately from the Regina website.
        - Modified the closed orientable census files to use more
          consistent choices of monodromy matrices for torus bundles.
        - Clarified the matrix notation used with graph manifolds.
    ENGINE:
        Class NClosedPrimeMinSearcher:
            - Census generation is much faster for larger numbers of
              tetrahedra, due to new tests for high-genus vertex links.
            - Also made census generation more efficient by pruning on
              high-degree edges (as well as the usual low-degree edges).
        Class NDoubleDescriptor:
            - Now a standalone class, since the base NVertexEnumerator
              has been removed.
            - Made all member functions static.  Objects of this class
              can no longer be created.
        Class NFacePairing:
            - Modified writeDot() to behave well with ancient versions
              of Graphviz.
        Class NHomologicalData:
            - New class for computing all sorts of detailed homological
              information for a manifold; thanks to Ryan Budney for this.
        Class NLargeInteger:
            - New routine divisionAlg() for using the division algorithm.
            - New routine legendre() for calculating Legendre symbols.
        Class NMatrix:
            - New == and != operators for element-by-element comparison.
        Class NMatrixInt:
            - Added a set() routine to the python interface for setting
              matrix elements (which was previously not possible in python).
            - Made matrix multiplication available in the python interface.
            - Added a python-only variant of initialise() that fills a
              matrix given a complete list of elements.
        Class NMatrixRing:
            - New routine det() for fast calculation of matrix determinants.
            - New convenience routine isIdentity().
            - Changed the return type of operator * from a raw pointer to a
              std::auto_ptr, to make it easier to multiply matrices inside
              temporary expressions.
            - Added a new multiplyAs() template routine that multiplies but
              (unlike operator *) returns a subclass of NMatrixRing.
        Class NMarkedAbelianGroup, NHomMarkedAbelianGroup:
            - New classes for working with groups defined by chain
              complexes; thanks to Ryan Budney for these.
        Class NPacket:
            - New routine reparent() to simplify ownership issues when
              using Python scripting.
        Class NPerm:
            - Micro-optimised routines that are called extremely frequently,
              such as sign().
        Class NPrimes:
            - New class that provides a more sophisticated infrastructure
              for prime factorisation than the old factorise() and
              primesUpTo() routines.
        Class NRational:
            - New routine abs() for calculating absolute value.
            - New routine doubleApprox() for converting to a real number.
        Struct NSatAnnulus:
            - New routine attachLST() to help with Seifert fibred spaces.
        Class NSFSpace:
            - Updated reduce() to make the best possible decisions on
              whether to reflect all fibres in cases where this is
              possible (previously it made faster decisions but
              occasionally missed some more subtle reductions).
            - Enhanced construct() to support the triangulation of all
              Seifert fibred spaces over the 2-sphere without punctures
              or reflector boundaries.
        Class NTetrahedron:
            - New routine orientation() for tracking orientation.
        Class NTorusBundle:
            - Greatly improved monodromy matrix reduction, to the point
              where equivalent torus bundles should give equal matrices.
            - Fixed a bug in the matrix reduction for non-symmetric
              matrices in non-orientable manifolds (sometimes the
              transpose matrix was obtained instead of the correct matrix).
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New routine layerOn() for performing layerings.
            - New routine dehydrate() for extracting Callahan-Hildebrand-Weeks
              dehydration strings.
            - Optimised the skeletal calculations, which now run *much* faster.
            - Renamed getEulerCharacteristic() to getEulerCharTri(), since for
              ideal triangulations this differs from the Euler characteristic
              of the corresponding compact manifold.  The old name is kept as
              an alias but is now deprecated.
            - Added a new routine getEulerCharManifold(), which *does* calculate
              the Euler characteristic of the corresponding compact manifold.
            - Fixed a crash in splitIntoComponents() that occurred when
              the triangulation skeleton had not yet been calculated.
        Class NVertexEnumerator:
            - Removed.  This abstract class existed to support multiple
              vertex enumeration algorithms, but in reality we're only
              using double descriptor anyway.  The virtual template
              member functions caused problems with g++-4.2, which was
              the final push.  NDoubleDescriptor is now a standalone class.
        Routine smithNormalForm():
            - New five-argument version that not only calculates the Smith
              normal form but also returns appropriate change of basis
              matrices; thanks to Ryan Budney.
        Routines columnEchelonForm() and preImageOfLattice():
            - New routines for working with matrices and homomorphisms;
              thanks again to Ryan Bydney.
        Routines factorise(), primesUpTo():
            - Deprecated in favour of routines from the new NPrimes class.
        Routine clonePtr():
            - New routine to assist copy constructors for classes that
              compute data on demand.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - New Algebra -> Cellular Info tab containing a variety of new
          homological data for triangulations; thanks to Ryan Budney.
        - Graphs now look better when drawn using an old Graphviz 1.x
          (previously the graphs were only tested under Graphviz 2.x).
        - Better infrastructure for determining the status of the
          current Graphviz installation.  For version 1.x, Regina now
          insists on using dot, since the old neato 1.x cannot handle
          multiple edges.
        - Removed the Crush column from normal surface lists, since it has
          never contained any information beyond "N/A" or "Unknown".
        - The Regina reference manual is now called the Regina handbook,
          for consistency with other KDE applications.
    PYTHON:
        - The regina-python tool has new options -i/--interactive (run a
          script and leave the interpreter open) and -n/--nolibs (do not
          load any of the normal user libraries).
    UTILITIES:
        trisetcmp:
            - Now outputs more appropriate messages when subcomplex testing
              (previously the same messages were used for both subcomplex
              testing and isomorphism testing).
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added a new test suite for python bindings, in addition to the
          usual C++ test suite that is already present.
        - Added tests for the NPerm class.
        - Added tests for vertex link calculations.
        - Added tests for the orientable double cover of a triangulation.
        - Added tests for the new NPrimes class.
        - Added division algorithm tests for NLargeInteger.
        - Added tests for the new NHomologicalData class.
        - Added tests for triangulation dehydrations and rehydrations.
        - Initial work on tests for the NRational class.
    BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
        - Updated libtool from version 1.5a to 1.5.22 with Debian patches
          (required for MacOS support).

Version 4.3.1  [ 5 May, 2006 ]

    ENGINE:
        Class NClosedPrimeMinSearcher:
            - Improved speed by adding additional face pairing graph
              tests; see math.GT/0604584 for details.
            - Made a very slight improvement in speed by testing for
              extremely high degree edges.
            - Fixed memory leak (the destructor was not deallocating some
              internal arrays).
            - Minor changes to the behaviour of mergeEdgeClasses()
              (might return only some flags instead of all flags).
        Class NFacePairing:
            - New constructor for building the face pairing of an
              existing triangulation.
            - New routines hasOneEndedChainWithStrayBigon() and
              hasTripleOneEndedChain() for testing for more types of
              graphs that cannot appear in a closed census.
            - New routines hasSingleStar(), hasDoubleStar() and
              hasDoubleSquare() for investigating larger face pairing graphs.
            - New routines writeDot() and writeDotHeader() to assist
              with graph visualisation.
        Routine readOrb():
            - New routine for importing Orb / Casson triangulations;
              thanks to Ryan Budney for contributing this import filter.
        Routine readSnapPea():
            - Verifies that the first line of the file is "% Triangulation",
              instead of simply testing for the '%' and ignoring the rest.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Now displays face pairing graphs in the triangulation viewer, using
          Graphviz for the rendering (see the Skeleton tab).  This required
          splitting the main Skeleton tab into two smaller child tabs.
        - New configuration options for the Graphviz executable and the
          default Skeleton child tab.
        - No longer crashes when attempting to clone the root packet
          (it simply displays an error message instead).
        - Added a workaround for the icon problems that arise when using
          GNU/Linux distributions with buggy icon themes.
        - Added 48x48 and 64x64 icons for Regina and its data files.
    TEST SUITE:
        - New tests for recognising bad and otherwise interesting subgraphs
          within face pairing graphs.

Version 4.3  [ 27 March, 2006 ]

    OVERALL:
        - Expanded the closed non-orientable census to 10 tetrahedra.
        - Expanded the closed orientable census to 10 tetrahedra, and
          split it into two data files (large and small).
        - Updated postal address for the Free Software Foundation.
        - Bibliographic updates for the reference manual.
        - Fixed some harmless compiler warnings, and tightened syntax
          to adhere to the requirements of gcc 4.1.
    ENGINE:
        Class LessDeref:
            - New utility class for working with pointers in the Standard
              Template Library.
        Class NGluingPerms, NGluingPermSearcher, NClosedPrimeMinSearcher:
            - Significant overhaul.
            - Moved gluing permutation search routines into new classes
              NGluingPermSearcher and NClosedPrimeMinSearcher.
            - Supports partial depth-based searching (by passing a
              non-negative depth parameter to the new runSearch() routine).
            - Tracks both vertex and edge links using a modified union
              find structure to prune more braches of the search tree
              where possible.  This makes an incredible difference to the
              census running time.  Pruning takes place on non-orientable
              vertex links, too many or too few vertices or edges, low
              degree or invalid edges, conical faces, and L(3,1) spines.
        Class NGraphLoop, NGraphPair, NGraphTriple:
            - New families of graph manifolds.
        Class NKnot:
            - Removed this unwritten placeholder class.
        Class NLayering:
            - New class to help follow through layerings of tetrahedra
              within a triangulation.
        Class NLayeredSolidTorus:
            - New routine formsLayeredSolidTorusTop() for finding an LST
              from the top end instead of the bottom.
            - New routine transform() for following through an isomorphism.
        Class NLayeredTorusBundle, NTxICore, NTxIDiagonalCore, NTxIParallelCore:
            - Added for recognition of layered surface bundles.
        Class NListOnCall:
            - New class for expensive and rarely used hard-coded lists.
        Class NManifold:
            - Routine writeTeXName() no longer provides wrapping dollar signs.
            - New operator < for ordering manifolds deterministically.
        Class NMatrix2:
            - New specialised class for working with 2-by-2 integer matrices.
        Class NPacket, NPacketListener:
            - New NPacket routine sortChildren().
            - Packet listeners are now unregistered immediately *before*
              packetToBeDestroyed() is called.  This avoids unpleasantries
              when a listener tries to unregister itself during this call.
        Class NPerm:
            - The assignment operator now returns a reference instead of void.
        Class NSatAnnulus, NSatBlock, NSatRegion, NBlockedSFS, NBlockedSFSLoop,
                  NBlockedSFSPair, NBlockedSFSTriple, NPluggedTorusBundle,
                  plus subclasses and other support structures:
            - New classes for recognising and describing Seifert fibred spaces
              and other graph manifolds that are built using saturated blocks.
        Class NSFS, NExceptionalFibre:
            - Removed; see below.
        Class NSFSpace, NSFSFibre:
            - Complete overhaul of the Seifert fibred space classes.
            - Now more general, supporting both orientable and
              non-orientable 3-manifolds as well as base orbifolds with
              reflector boundary components.
            - Classes have been renamed from the old NSFS / NExceptionalFibre
              to make it clear that large-scale changes have taken place.
        Class NSFSAltSet:
            - New class for finding alternative simple representations of
              the same bounded Seifert fibred space.
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - Added a boolean argument to the constructor that permits the
              SnapPea kernel to work with closed triangulations if the user
              really wants to allow it.
        Class NStandardTri:
            - Routine writeTeXName() no longer provides wrapping dollar signs.
        Class NTorusBundle:
            - New class of 3-manifolds describing torus bundles over the
              circle.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Combined isomorphism and subcomplex testing routines into
              a single all-in-one routine to avoid excessive code reuse.
            - Added new subcomplex testing routine findAllSubcomplexesIn(),
              in which all matches (not just the first) are returned.
            - Routines getTetrahedronIndex(), getComponentIndex(),
              getBoundaryComponentIndex(), getFaceIndex(), getEdgeIndex()
              and getVertexIndex() now returned signed instead of unsigned
              longs, so that -1 can be returned if the object could not
              be found.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Added a configuration option that allows the SnapPea kernel to
          work with closed triangulations.
        - Fixed the crash when deleting a triangulation that is currently the
          target of an isomorphism/subcomplex test.
        - Fixed a crash that sometimes occurs in large files when deleting
          a triangulation that is currently being viewed.
        - Fixed extremely slow updates in the triangulation composition tab
          for very large data files.
        - Text and script packets now open with the cursor at the top
          instead of the bottom.
    PYTHON:
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - Offers the additional zero-argument routine volumeWithPrecision()
              as a way of returning the precision of the volume calculation.
    UTILITIES:
        tricensus-mpi:
            - Significant overhaul.
            - Now supports finer-grained subsearches via --depth.
            - Better logging.
            - Only writes .rga data files for cases in which at least
              one triangulation was found.
            - New option --dryrun for a quick overview of the search space.
        tricensus-mpi-status:
            - New tool for parsing tricensus-mpi logs.
        trisetcmp:
            - Support subcomplex testing as well as isomorphism testing.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Don't enforce precision limits for degenerate snappea volume
          testing, to allow for flexibility in floating point behaviours
          of different chipsets.
        - Added tests for NIsomorphism.

Version 4.2.1  [ 18 September, 2005 ]

    OVERALL:
        - Added a chapter on imports and exports to the reference manual.
        - Expanded the closed non-orientable census to eight tetrahedra.
    ENGINE:
        Overall structure:
            - Fixed "regina-engine-config --cflags", which wrote includes
              for Regina's dependencies but not for Regina itself (sigh).
        Class NIsomorphism:
            - New routine random() for generating random isomorphisms.
            - New routine apply() for permuting the tetrahedra and
              vertices/faces of an existing triangulation.
            - New routine isIdentity() for testing for identity isomorphisms.
        Routine writeSnapPea():
            - Add a precondition that the triangulation has no boundary faces.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Refuse to export a triangulation to SnapPea format if it
          has boundary faces.
    UTILITIES:
        trisetcmp:
            - New utility for comparing two different sets of triangulations.

Version 4.2  [ 7 July, 2005 ]

    ENGINE:
        Overall structure:
            - Included portions of the SnapPea kernel!  Thanks again to
              Jeff Weeks for his support.
            - Added a regina-engine-config script to make it easier to
              build Regina's calculation engine into other applications.
        Class NExampleTriangulation:
            - Added to facilitate construction of several different
              ready-made sample triangulations.
        Class NFacePairing:
            - New routine hasWedgedDoubleEndedChain.
        Class NLayeredSolidTorus:
            - New routine isLayeredSolidTorus for classifying an entire
              triangulation component.
        Class NPacketListener:
            - Added an extra boolean argument to childWasRemoved() to indicate
              the situation in which the parent is also being destroyed.
        Class NSnapPeaCensusManifold, NSnapPeaCensusTri:
            - Added to aid recognition of very small SnapPea census
              triangulations.
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - Added to give Regina triangulations access to the SnapPea kernel.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New routine finiteToIdeal() for extending a triangulation.
            - New routines insertConstruction() and dumpConstruction() to
              make it easier to hard-code triangulations in source code.
            - Fixed vertex link calculations, which were previously
              incorrect if a triangulation contained invalid edges.
            - Fixed bug in twoZeroMove() which caused a crash in some cases
              involving triangulations with boundary.
        Class NTrivialTri:
            - Added recognition of one-tetrahedron balls.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Include several example triangulations in the triangulation
          creation dialog.
        - Allow exporting a triangulation to C++ source.
        - Renamed "Ideal to Finite" as "Truncate Ideal Vertices" in the menu.
        - Include a padlock in the corner of a packet icon if the packet
          is uneditable.
        - Tighter thread safety in the GUI.  This is required because some
          calculations (such as surface enumeration) run in a separate thread.
        - Worked around a Qt bug that caused a crash when pressing a key in
          a table of normal surfaces or matching equations.
        - Fixed a bug in which GAP output was unparseable due to GAP
          inserting spaces where Regina was not expecting them.
    UTILITIES:
        tricensus-mpi:
            - New census manager for use on MPI-enabled clusters.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added tests for SnapPea calculations.
        - Further additions to the triangulation tests, in particular
          involving invalid and non-standard triangulations.
        - Beginning of a series of tests for elementary moves.
    BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
        - Updated libtool to version 1.5a.  Hopefully this will make
          things better for Darwin/Fink.
        - Requires KDE >= 3.2, so that the XDG applications directory can
          be used for the desktop file.
        - Verifies in the configure script that shared libraries are
          enabled where necessary (i.e., in the KDE and Python interfaces).
        - Better magic in the configure script for finding the correct
          boost.python libraries.
        - Fixed a bug in the configure script whereby -g stripping was
          too agressive, resulting in a compile failure for the python
          interface under some environments.

Version 4.1.3  [ 25 July, 2004 ]

    OVERALL:
        - Included the closed hyperbolic census of Hodgson and Weeks.
        - Made explicit in the reference manual introduction where the
          example files can be found.
    PYTHON:
        - For most objects, == now works like C++ pointer equality
          instead of Python object equality.  That is, it tests whether
          the Python wrappers point to the same C++ object, not whether
          the Python wrappers are in fact the same wrapper.
        - Fixed scripting in the GUI, which was broken with python 2.3
          (indented blocks were treated as complete after just one line).
        - Added a sample python session illustrating progress reporting.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Added an "Open Example" menu item for easy access to the
          sample files.
        - Allow the choice of text editor component to be configured.
        - Several fixes to make Regina work properly with the vimpart,
          including work-arounds for bugs in the vimpart itself.
        - Fixed the massive resource drain while editing a script's
          variable table in a heavily populated data file.
        - Fixed crashes that occured when deleting packets while a
          drop-down packet chooser is in use elsewhere.
        - Tightened up the handling of read-only mode for internal
          components.  Also removed some loopholes that allowed editing
          of uneditable packets.
        - Improved handling of keyboard focus.
        - Changed "Python Reference" to point to the modules index
          instead of the title page.

Version 4.1.2  [ 14 June, 2004 ]
    OVERALL:
        - Updated configure scripts so that the python interface builds
          out of the box on a larger number of platforms (specifically Red Hat
          and Fedora Core are now supported).  Many thanks to Craig Macintyre
          for his patience and assistance with this.
        - More updates to the troubleshooting section; overhauled the
          README.txt and website to hopefully make everything clearer
          and the important information easier to find.
        - Added a suggested form for citing Regina.
        - Updated INSTALL.txt to reflect current --prefix guessing.
    ENGINE:
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Added simplifiedFundamentalGroup() to allow external bodies
              such as GAP to simplify group presentations.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Allow users to simplify fundamental groups using GAP.
        - Added "Education" to the categories for the desktop file, since
          KDE seems adamant about having no separate maths/science menu.
          Anything is better than showing up in Lost & Found. :)
        - Fixed compile error when building against an STL-enabled Qt
          (thanks to Robert Myers for spotting this one).

Version 4.1.1  [ 24 April, 2004 ]
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Fixed compile error when building against Python 2.3.
        - Added "What's This?" button to main/packet window decorations.

Version 4.1  [ 7 March, 2004 ]
    OVERALL:
        - Further enhancements to the reference manual, including more
          detailed explanations in the main body as well as a new index.
    ENGINE:
        Class NNormalSurface:
            - New routine doubleSurface().
            - Added findNonTrivialSphere() and findVtxOctAlmostNormalSphere()

            - Added timing utilities getRealTime() and totalCPUTime().
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New 0-efficiency / decomposition routines splitIntoComponents(),
              connectedSumDecomposition(), isThreeSphere(), knowsThreeSphere()
              and makeZeroEfficient().
            - New Seifert fibred space constructions insertAugTriSolidTorus()
              and insertSFSOverSphere().
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Actions specific to each packet type now appear in their own
          context-specific menus, i.e., a "Triangulation" menu appears
          when a triangulation is open, etc.
        - Added "Please Wait" dialogs during slow operations.
        - Thorough "What's This?" support and tooltips offered across the
          entire user interface.
        - New tip-of-the-day support.
        - More icons for triangulation actions.
        - Updated the .desktop file and mimetype tests to work correctly
          with KDE 3.2.
    UTILITIES:
        tricensus:
            - Fixed bug in which --genpairs created empty output files.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added tests for connected sum decomposition.

Version 4.0.1  [ 26 January, 2004 ]
    OVERALL:
        - The ./configure script now takes a guess at the correct --prefix,
          runs sanity tests upon it and insists upon Qt >= 3.2.
        - Regina now ships with pregenerated manpages to avoid the need
          for docbook-utils and its complicated dependencies.
        - The troubleshooting section of the reference manual now
          includes compile-time problems and discusses the test suite.
    USER INTERFACE:
        Class GridListViewItem:
            - Added to centralise support for list views with grids.
            - Fixed a compile error with Qt versions 3.1 and earlier.

Version 4.0  [ 20 December, 2003 ]
    ENGINE:
        Class NAngleStructureList:
            - Enumeration routine now takes an optional progress manager
              and can run in a separate thread.
        Class NGroupPresentation:
