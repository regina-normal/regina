Description: Regina, the 3-manifold normal surface theory calculator
 Regina is a topological calculator with a bent towards normal surface
 theory. It allows 3-manifolds to be created and manipulated and their
 properties of interest to be determined.
 .
 Highlights of Regina include triangulation analysis and simplification,
 census creation and normal surface enumeration.  It offers embedded
 Python scripting giving full access to the calculation engine.
 .
 This package includes the KDE user interface and the command-line
 Python interface, as well as the users' reference manual.  See the
 packages regina-normal-dev and regina-normal-doc if you wish to build
 the Regina calculation engine into your own projects.
