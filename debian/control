Description: Regina, the 3-manifold normal surface theory calculator
 Regina is a topological calculator with a bent towards normal surface
 theory. It allows 3-manifolds to be created, manipulated and their
 properties of interest determined. 
 .
 Highlights of Regina include triangulation analysis and simplification,
 census creation and normal surface enumeration.  It offers embedded
 Jython scripting giving full access to the calculation engine.
