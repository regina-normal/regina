regina-normal (4.3.1-1ubuntu1) unstable; urgency=low

regina-normal (4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * C++ syntax now adheres to the requirements of gcc 4.1 (closes: #358062).

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Mar 2006 08:48:41 +1100

regina-normal (4.2.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depends on kdelibs4-dev (>= 4:3.5.1-3), so that the cached HTML
    reference manual has the correct legal notice (GPL).  The meinproc from
    older versions of kdelibs incorrectly claimed that all documentation was
    under the GFDL instead.

regina-normal (4.2.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Temporarily ship ia64 packages without MPI utilities, since the MPI code
    fails to link under ia64.  These utilities will be restored once the link
    failure can be tracked down.
  * All architectures other than ia64 are unaffected by this change.

    caused by taking log10(0) when the answers are very, very accurate.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Jan 2006 11:00:41 +1100

regina-normal (4.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to debian's patched libtool 1.5.22.  This should support
    Debian GNU/k*BSD, and should also streamline package dependencies
    (closes: #343965).
  * Build-depends on automake1.9 since we now need to rerun autoconf,
    automake and friends.
  * Applied the debian/KDE disable_no_undefine patch to admin/kde.m4.ext,
    which is needed because of the libtool update.
  * Made the NSnapPeaTriangulation tests more flexible for degenerate
    triangulations, to allow for different floating point behaviour under
    different chipsets (closes: #326790).
  * Bumped standards-version to 3.6.2.2 (no changes required).
