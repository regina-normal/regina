.SH NAME
regina-gui \- Regina's graphical user interface
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBregina-gui\fR [ \fB\fIfile\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Regina is a software package for studying 3-manifold triangulations
and normal surfaces.  Other key features include
angle structures, census enumeration, combinatorial
recognition of triangulations, and high-level tasks such as
3-sphere recognition and connected sum decomposition.
Regina comes with a full graphical user interface, and also offers
Python bindings and a low-level C++ programming interface.
.PP
This starts the full graphical user interface, and is the usual
way of starting Regina.  Any files passed on the command-line
will be opened on startup.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
The following environment variables influence the behaviour of
this program.
.TP
\fB\fIREGINA_PYLIBDIR\fB\fR
The directory containing the Python module
\fIregina\fR\&.

If you have installed Regina's Python module in a standard
Python location (i.e., Python can import it directly without
extending sys.path), then
\fIREGINA_PYLIBDIR\fR should be left empty or undefined.

Normally you should not need to set this option yourself.
This program should know how to find Regina's Python module
in standard situations, which include
fixed filesystem installations (e.g., \fBGNU/Linux\fR and \fBWindows\fR),
relocatable app bundles (e.g., \fBmacOS\fR),
and running directly from the source tree.
.TP
\fB\fIREGINA_HOME\fB\fR
The directory beneath which Regina's data files are installed.
These include (amongst other things) example files in
\fI$REGINA_HOME/examples/\fR,
API documentation in
\fI$REGINA_HOME/engine-docs/\fR,
and census databases in
\fI$REGINA_HOME/data/census/\fR\&.

Normally you should not need to set this option yourself.
This program should know how to find its data files in standard
situations, which include
fixed filesystem installations (e.g., \fBGNU/Linux\fR and \fBWindows\fR),

.SH "MACOS USERS"
.PP
If you downloaded a drag-and-drop app bundle, this is the
program that runs when you open it.
The executable itself is simply called \fBRegina\fR,
not \fBregina-gui\fR\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
regina-python\&.
.PP
Regina comes with a rich users' handbook, which you can access via
Help->Regina Handbook
in the menu.  You can also read the users' handbook online
at \fBhttp://regina-normal.github.io/docs/\fR\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
Many people have been involved in the development
of Regina; see the users' handbook for a full list of credits.
