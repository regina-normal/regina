.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBregina-gui\fR [ \fB\fIfile\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]

Regina is a software package for studying 3-manifold triangulations
and normal surfaces.  Other key features include
angle structures, census enumeration, combinatorial
recognition of triangulations, and high-level tasks such as
3-sphere recognition and connected sum decomposition.
Regina comes with a full graphical user interface, and also offers
Python bindings and a low-level C++ programming interface.

This starts the full graphical user interface, and is the usual
way of starting Regina.  Any files passed on the command-line
will be opened on startup.
