.SH NAME
censuslookup \- Search for triangulations in Regina's census databases
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBcensuslookup\fR \fB\fIisosig\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This utility searches for the given 3-manifold triangulations in the various
census databases that are shipped withRegina.
.PP
You should present the trianguations using their \fIisomorphism
signatures\fR\&.  These are short text strings that identify
the triangulation uniquely up to combinatorial isomorphism
(i.e., up to relabellings of the tetrahedra and/or their vertices).
.PP
From the graphical user interface, you can view the isomorphism signature
of a triangulation by switching to the Composition
tab in the triangulation viewer.  From Python you can fetch the
isomorphism signature of the triangulation \fBx\fR
by calling \fBx.isoSig()\fR\&.
For a full and precise specification of isomorphism signatures, see
\fBSimplification paths in the Pachner graphs of closed
orientable 3-manifold triangulations\fR, Burton, 2011,
arXiv:1110.6080.
.PP
All database matches (if any) will be written to standard output.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
The following environment variables influence the behaviour of
this program.
.TP
\fB\fIREGINA_HOME\fB\fR
The directory beneath which Regina's data files are installed.
This utility will look for the census databases in the subdirectory
\fI$REGINA_HOME/data/census/\fR\&.

Normally you should not need to set this option yourself.
This utility should know how to find its census databases in standard
situations, which include
fixed filesystem installations (e.g., \fBGNU/Linux\fR and \fBWindows\fR),
relocatable app bundles (e.g., \fBmacOS\fR),
and running directly from the source tree.
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf
    example$ \fBcensuslookup fvPQcdecedekrsnrs dLQbcccajqs cPcbbbiht\fR
    fvPQcdecedekrsnrs: 1 hit
        SFS [S2: (2,1) (3,1) (5,-4)] : #1 -- Closed census (orientable)

    dLQbcccajqs: 0 hits

    cPcbbbiht: 2 hits
        m004 : #1 -- Cusped hyperbolic census (orientable)
        L104001 -- Hyperbolic knot and link complements

.SH "MACOS USERS"
.PP
If you downloaded a drag-and-drop app bundle, this utility is
shipped inside it.  If you dragged Regina to the main
Applications folder, you can run it as
/Applications/Regina.app/Contents/MacOS/censuslookup\&.
.SH "WINDOWS USERS"
.PP
The command-line utilities are installed beneath the
\fIProgram\~Files\fR directory; on some
machines this directory is called
\fIProgram\~Files\~(x86)\fR\&.
You can start this utility by running
c:\\Program\~Files\\Regina\\Regina\~7.0\\bin\\censuslookup.exe\&.
