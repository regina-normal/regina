.SH NAME
regina-engine-config \- Get compiler and linker flags to build software against Regina
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBregina-engine-config\fR [ \fB--prefix\fR ] [ \fB--version\fR ] [ \fB--cflags\fR ] [ \fB--libs\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This utility tells you which compiler and linker flags should be used to
build the mathematical engine of Regina into your own programs.
Regina's mathematical engine is typically installed in the library
\fIlibregina-engine.so\fR\&.
.PP
This utility is only available in some settings:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
If you are using \fBGNU/Linux\fR and you have Regina installed in a system
location (e.g., beneath \fI/usr/\fR or
\fI/usr/local/\fR), then
\fBregina-engine-config\fR should be included with your
installation, and it should output compiler/linker flags relative to
this system installation.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
If you are building Regina yourself from the source tree (on any
platform), then you can run \fBregina-engine-config\fR
from the source tree, and it should output compiler/linker flags
relative to the same source tree.  In particular, you do not need to
install Regina for these compiler/linker flags to work.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
If you are using pre-built packages for Regina on \fBmacOS\fR or \fBWindows\fR,
then \fBregina-engine-config\fR will not be included in your
installation.
.PP
Instead of using \fBregina-engine-config\fR as part of the
compilation process, you may find it easier to create a Makefile using
\fBregina-helper\fR
and then just use \fBmake\fR instead.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB--prefix\fR
Prints the installation prefix where Regina has been installed.
.TP
\fB--version\fR
Prints the currently installed version of Regina.  This will
include any \fIBUILD_INFO\fR string that was set
when Regina was built.
.TP
\fB--cflags\fR
Print the compiler flags that are required to compile a program
that uses the Regina calculation engine.
.TP
\fB--libs\fR
Print the linker flags that are required to link a program against
the Regina calculation engine.
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf
    example$ \fBregina-engine-config --cflags\fR
    -std=c++20
    -I/usr/include/regina-normal -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/libxml2
    example$

This script was long ago based on \fBgtk-config\fR,
though very little of that remains nowadays.  The original
\fBgtk-config\fR was Copyright\~(C)\~1998

\fBregina-engine-config\fR script for full details.
