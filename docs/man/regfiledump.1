.SH NAME
regfiledump \- Dump the contents of a Regina data file
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBregfiledump\fR [ \fB-f\fR | \fB-l\fR | \fB-n\fR ] [ \fB-c\fR ] \fB\fIfile\fB\fR [ \fB\fIpacket-label\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This utility dumps the contents of the given Regina data file to
standard output in a human-readable format.
.PP
If a list of packet labels is given on the command-line, only those
packets will be output.  Otherwise all packets in the given
file will be output.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-f (default)\fR
Output full packet details.  The output for each packet will cover
several lines, beginning with basic details (such as the packet label
and type) followed by the packet's long description.
.TP
\fB-l\fR
Output a list of packet labels and types only, one packet per line.
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Don't output any packets at all; this option forces a packet
count (see option \fB-c\fR).
.TP
\fB-c\fR
Finish the output with a total count of all packets in the
file.
.SH "INTERNATIONALISATION"
.PP
If any packets contain international characters,
Regina will attempt to convert these to your local character
encoding as it writes them to the output.
.PP
You can tell Regina what character encoding to use by setting
standard locale-related environment variables, such as
\fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR or
\fBLC_ALL\fR\&.
.PP
For example, if \fBLANG\fR is set to
en_AU then output will be written in the
Western European character set ISO-8859-1,
and if \fBLANG\fR is set to
en_AU.UTF-8 then output will be written in the
universal character set UTF-8\&.
.PP
Typically these environment variables will already be set for you when
you install your \fBGNU/Linux\fR system, and Regina will just use the
right character set out of the box.  See your \fBGNU/Linux\fR system reference
for further information on supporting different locales.
.SH "MACOS\\~X USERS"
.PP
If you downloaded a drag-and-drop app bundle, this utility is
shipped inside it.  If you dragged Regina to the main
Applications folder, you can run it as
/Applications/Regina.app/Contents/MacOS/regfiledump\&.
.SH "WINDOWS USERS"
.PP
The command-line utilities are installed beneath the
\fIProgram\~Files\fR directory; on some
machines this directory is called
\fIProgram\~Files\~(x86)\fR\&.
You can start this utility by running
c:\\Program\~Files\\Regina\\Regina\~5.1\\bin\\regfiledump.exe\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
regina-gui\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"

Many people have been involved in the development
of Regina; see the users' handbook for a full list of credits.
