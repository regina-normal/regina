.SH NAME
sigcensus \- Form a census of splitting surface signatures
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBsigcensus\fR \fB\fIorder\fB\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Forms a census of all splitting surface signatures of the given
order.  The \fIorder\fR is the number of
quadrilaterals in the resulting splitting surface.
.PP
The signatures will be written to standard output, one per
line, followed by a count of the total number of signatures found.
.PP
Each signature will be output precisely once up to equivalence.
Signatures are considered equivalent if they are related by some
combination of:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
relabelling symbols;
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
rotating an individual cycle;
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
inverting an individual cycle (i.e., reversing the cycle and
changing the case of each symbol in the cycle);
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
reversing all cycles without changing the case of any
symbols.
.PP
Upper-case symbols in signatures are not yet supported; this
program will only output signatures whose symbols are all lower-case.
.PP

Burton's PhD thesis at \fBhttp://www.maths.uq.edu.au/~bab/papers/\fR\&.
.SH "MACOS\\~X USERS"
.PP
If you downloaded a drag-and-drop app bundle, this utility is
shipped inside it.  If you dragged Regina to the main
Applications folder, you can run it as
/Applications/Regina.app/Contents/MacOS/sigcensus\&.
.SH "WINDOWS USERS"
.PP
The command-line utilities are installed beneath the
\fIProgram\~Files\fR directory; on some
machines this directory is called
\fIProgram\~Files\~(x86)\fR\&.
You can start this utility by running
c:\\Program\~Files\\Regina\\Regina\~5.1\\bin\\sigcensus.exe\&.
