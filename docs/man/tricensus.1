.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Forms a census of all 3-manifold triangulations satisfying a
particular set of conditions.
.PP
The only condition that must be provided is the number of tetrahedra
used to build the triangulations.  Additional constraints may be
specified on the command-line as described below.
.PP
Each triangulation will be output precisely once up to combinatorial
isomorphism.  Invalid triangulations (triangulations with edges
identified to themselves in reverse or boundary vertices whose links
are not discs) will not be output at all.
.PP
As the census progresses, the state of progress will be written (slowly)
to standard output.  Once the census is complete, the census itself will
be saved to the given file.
.PP
Note that options \fB--genpairs\fR and
\fB--usepairs\fR may be used to split a census into smaller
pieces to be run simultaneously on different machines.  See also the
\fBtricensus-manager\fR
and
\fBtricensus-mpi\fR
utilities, which can help coordinate these simultaneous processes.
.sp
.RS
.B "Warning:"
A census with even a relatively small number of tetrahedra can
take an incredibly long time to run and chew up massive amounts of
memory.  It is recommended that you try very small censuses to begin
with (such as 3 or 4 tetrahedra) and work upwards to establish the
limits relative to your machine.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-t, --tetrahedra=\fItetrahedra\fB\fR
Specifies the number of tetrahedra used to build the triangulations.
.TP
\fB-b, --boundary\fR
Only produce triangulations with at least one boundary face.
.TP
\fB-i, --internal\fR
Only produce triangulations with all faces internal (i.e., with no
boundary faces).
.TP
\fB-B, --bdryfaces=\fIfaces\fB\fR
Only produce triangulations with the precise number of boundary
faces specified.
.TP
\fB-o, --orientable\fR
Only produce orientable triangulations.
.TP
\fB-n, --nonorientable\fR
Only produce non-orientable triangulations.
.TP
\fB-f, --finite\fR
Only produce finite triangulations (triangulations with no
ideal vertices).
.TP
\fB-d, --ideal\fR
Only produce triangulations with at least one ideal vertex.
.TP
\fB-m, --minimal\fR
Do not include triangulations that are obviously non-minimal.

A series of short tests will be run on each triangulation produced;
if a triangulation is found to be non-minimal it will not be placed
in the census.

Note that these tests are not capable of deciding that a
triangulation \fBis\fR minimal; at best the results
will be inconclusive (in which case the triangulation will be placed
in the census anyway).
.TP
\fB-M, --minprime\fR
Do not include triangulations that are obviously non-minimal,
non-prime and/or disc-reducible.

This option can significantly speed up the census and vastly
reduce the final number of triangulations produced.

A triangulation satisfying any of the above conditions might be
left out of the census, although not all such triangulations will
be ignored.  What \fBis\fR guaranteed is that any
triangulation that is minimal, prime and disc-irreducible will
certainly be included in the census.
.TP
\fB-N, --minprimep2\fR
Do not include triangulations that are obviously non-minimal,
non-prime, P2-reducible and/or disc-reducible.

As with the \fB--minprime\fR option,
this option can significantly speed up the census and vastly
reduce the final number of triangulations produced.

A triangulation satisfying any of the above conditions might be
left out of the census, although not all such triangulations will
be ignored.  What \fBis\fR guaranteed is that any
triangulation that is minimal, prime, P2-irreducible and
disc-irreducible will certainly be included in the census.
.TP
\fB-p, --genpairs\fR
Only generate face pairings, not triangulations.

The outermost layer of the census code involves pairing off the
faces of the individual tetrahedra without actually determining
the corresponding gluing permutations.  For each face pairing
produced, all possible sets of gluing permutations are then generated
and corresponding triangulations created.

Face pairing generation consumes a very small fraction of the
total census runtime, and effectively divides the census into
multiple pieces.  By using this option, one can quickly generate
a complete list of possible face pairings and then feed subsets of
this list to different machines to work on simultaneously in order
to produce an overall census of triangulations.  See the
\fBtricensus-manager\fR
and
\fBtricensus-mpi\fR
utilities for assistance in coordinating these simultaneous processes.

The list of all face pairings will be written to the given output
file in text format (although in the special case of face pairing
generation you may omit the output file from the command-line, in
which case the pairings will be written to standard output).
This program can then be run with option \fB--usepairs\fR
to generate the actual triangulations corresponding to different
subsets of these face pairings.

Note that orientability, finiteness or minimality options may not be
supplied with this option; they should instead be supplied when option
\fB--usepairs\fR is used to process each subset of face
pairings.

Note also that when this option is used no progress reporting will
take place (although the face pairings should be generated
sufficiently quickly that the output file itself can be used to
track the state of progress).
.TP
\fB-P, --usepairs\fR
Use only the given subset of face pairings to build the triangulations.

Each face pairing that is processed \fBmust\fR be
in canonical form, i.e., must be a minimal representative of its
isomorphism class.  Note that the face pairings generated by option
\fB--genpairs\fR all satisfy this condition.

Face pairings should be supplied on standard input, one per line.
They should be listed in the format produced by option
\fB--genpairs\fR\&.

This option is used to run only a subset of a particular census.  See
option \fB--genpairs\fR for further details on how to split
a census into subsets to run simultaneously on different machines.
See also the
\fBtricensus-manager\fR
and
\fBtricensus-mpi\fR
utilities, which can help coordinate these simultaneous processes.

Note that tetrahedron or boundary options may not be supplied with
this option; they should instead be supplied when option
\fB--genpairs\fR is used to split the full census into
pieces.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The following command forms a census of all 3-tetrahedron closed
non-orientable triangulations and puts the results in the file
\fIresults.rga\fR\&.  To ensure that triangulations are
closed we use the options \fB-i\fR (no boundary faces)
and \fB-f\fR (no ideal vertices).

.nf
    example$ \fBtricensus -t 3 -nif results.rga\fR
    Progress reports are periodic.
    Not all face pairings used will be reported.
    0:1 0:0 1:0 1:1 | 0:2 0:3 2:0 2:1 | 1:2 1:3 2:3 2:2
    Finished.
    Total triangulations: 5
    example$
.fi
.PP
The following command forms a census of 4-tetrahedron closed
orientable triangulations, where the census creation is optimised
for prime minimal triangulations.  Although all prime minimal
triangulations will be included, there may be some non-prime or
non-minimal triangulations that are left out.

.nf
    example$ \fBtricensus -t 4 -oifM results.rga\fR
    Progress reports are periodic.
    Not all face pairings used will be reported.
    0:1 0:0 1:0 1:1 | 0:2 0:3 2:0 2:1 | 1:2 1:3 3:0 3:1 | 2:2 ...
    1:0 1:1 2:0 3:0 | 0:0 0:1 2:1 3:1 | 0:2 1:2 3:2 3:3 | 0:3 ...
    Finished.
    Total triangulations: 17
    example$
.fi
.PP
The following command generates all face pairings for a
5-tetrahedron census where triangulations must have precisely two
boundary faces.  The face pairings will be written to
\fIpairings.txt\fR, whereupon they can be broken up
and distributed for processing at a later date.

.nf
    example$ \fBtricensus --genpairs -t 5 -B 2 pairings.txt\fR
    Total face pairings: 118
    example$
.fi
.PP
The face pairings generated in the previous example can then be fleshed
out into a full census of all 3-manifold triangulations with five
tetrahedra, precisely two boundary faces and no ideal vertices as
follows.  Note that the number of tetrahedra and boundary faces were
already specified in the previous command and do not need to be
supplied again.  The face pairings will be read from
\fIpairings.txt\fR and the final census will be
written to \fIresults.rga\fR\&.

.nf
    example$ \fBtricensus --usepairs -f results.rga < pairings.txt\fR
    Trying face pairings...
    0:1 0:0 1:0 1:1 | 0:2 0:3 2:0 2:1 | 1:2 1:3 3:0 3:1 | 2:2 ...
