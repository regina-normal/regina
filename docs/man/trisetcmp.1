.SH NAME
trisetcmp \- Compare triangulations between two Regina data files
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBtrisetcmp\fR [ \fB-m\fR | \fB-n\fR ] [ \fB-s\fR ] \fB\fIfile1\fB\fR \fB\fIfile2\fB\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This utility compares all triangulations in the first file against
all triangulations in the second file.  Specifically, it looks to
see which triangulations from \fIfile1\fR are
isomorphic to which triangulations from
\fIfile2\fR\&.
.PP
The two given files must be \fBRegina\fR data files.
A full list of matches (or a full list of non-matches if
\fB-n\fR is passed) is written to standard output.
.PP
This utility can also do subcomplex testing instead of full
isomorphism testing.  See the option \fB-s\fR for
details.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-m (default)\fR
Output matches only.  All isomorphic matches between
triangulations in \fIfile1\fR
and triangulations in \fIfile2\fR
will be listed.
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Output non-matches only.  All triangulations from
\fIfile1\fR with no isomorphic match in
\fIfile2\fR will be listed, and vice versa.

The behaviour of this option is slightly different when
\fB-s\fR is passed; in particular, non-matches are
only tested in one direction only (there is no vice versa as indicated
above).
.TP
\fB-s\fR
Instead of testing triangulations for isomorphism, test whether
one triangulation is isomorphic to a subcomplex of the other.

In the default case of \fB-m\fR (output matches only),
this program outputs all instances where a triangulation from
\fIfile1\fR is isomorphic to a subcomplex
of a triangulation from \fIfile2\fR\&.

In the case of \fB-n\fR (output non-matches only),
this program outputs all triangulations from
\fIfile1\fR that are not isomorphic to a
subcomplex of any triangulation from \fIfile2\fR\&.
.SH "INTERNATIONALISATION"
.PP
If any packets contain international characters,
\fBRegina\fR will attempt to convert these to your local character
encoding as it writes them to the output.
.PP
You can tell \fBRegina\fR what character encoding to use by setting
standard locale-related environment variables, such as
\fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR or
\fBLC_ALL\fR\&.
.PP
For example, if \fBLANG\fR is set to
en_AU then output will be written in the
Western European character set ISO-8859-1,
and if \fBLANG\fR is set to
en_AU.UTF-8 then output will be written in the
universal character set UTF-8\&.
.PP
Typically these environment variables will have been set for you when
you installed your GNU/Linux system, and \fBRegina\fR should just use the
right character set out of the box.  See your GNU/Linux system reference
for further information on support for different locales.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
regina-kde\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
\fBRegina\fR was written by Ben Burton <bab@debian.org> with help from others;
see the documentation for full details.
