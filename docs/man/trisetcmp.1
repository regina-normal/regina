.SH NAME
trisetcmp \- Compare triangulations between two Regina data files
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBtrisetcmp\fR [ \fB-m\fR | \fB-n\fR ] [ \fB-s\fR ] \fB\fIfile1\fB\fR \fB\fIfile2\fB\fR


\fBtrisetcmp\fR { \fB-v, --version\fR | \fB-?, --help\fR }

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Compares all triangulations in the first file against
all triangulations in the second file, looking for pairs of
triangulations that are combinatorially isomorphic.
.PP
The two given files must be Regina data files.
A full list of matches (or a full list of non-matches if
\fB-n\fR is passed) is written to standard output.
A match occurs when some triangulation from
\fIfile1\fR is combinatorially isomorphic to
some triangulation from \fIfile2\fR (i.e.,
identical up to a relabelling of tetrahedra and their vertices).
.PP
This utility can also do subcomplex testing instead of full
isomorphism testing.  See the option \fB-s\fR for
details.
.PP
This utility compares both 3-manifold and 4-manifold triangulations
(but no other dimensions at present).
However, it will only compare triangulations of the same
dimension - it will not test whether some 3-manifold triangulation
appears as a subcomplex of some other 4-manifold triangulation.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-m (default)\fR
Output matches only.  All isomorphic matches between
triangulations in \fIfile1\fR
and triangulations in \fIfile2\fR
will be listed.
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Output non-matches only.  All triangulations from
\fIfile1\fR with no isomorphic match in
\fIfile2\fR will be listed, and vice versa.

If \fB-s\fR is passed then non-matches are
tested in one direction only, not both; see below for details.
.TP
\fB-s\fR
Instead of testing triangulations for isomorphism, test whether
one triangulation is isomorphic to a subcomplex of the other.

In the default case of \fB-m\fR (output matches only),
this program outputs all instances where a triangulation from
\fIfile1\fR is isomorphic to a subcomplex
of a triangulation from \fIfile2\fR\&.

In the case of \fB-n\fR (output non-matches only),
this program outputs all triangulations from
\fIfile1\fR that are not isomorphic to a
subcomplex of any triangulation from \fIfile2\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-v, --version\fR
Show which version of Regina is being used, and exit
immediately.
.TP
\fB-?, --help\fR
Display brief usage information, and exit immediately.
.SH "INTERNATIONALISATION"
.PP
If any packets contain international characters,
Regina will attempt to convert these to your local character
encoding as it writes them to the output.
.PP
You can tell Regina what character encoding to use by setting
standard locale-related environment variables, such as
\fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR or
\fBLC_ALL\fR\&.
.PP
For example, if \fBLANG\fR is set to
en_AU then output will be written in the
Western European character set ISO-8859-1,
and if \fBLANG\fR is set to
en_AU.UTF-8 then output will be written in the
universal character set UTF-8\&.
.PP
Typically these environment variables will already be set for you when
you install your \fBGNU/Linux\fR system, and Regina will just use the
right character set out of the box.  See your \fBGNU/Linux\fR system reference
for further information on supporting different locales.
.SH "MACOS USERS"
.PP
If you downloaded a drag-and-drop app bundle, this utility is
shipped inside it.  If you dragged Regina to the main
Applications folder, you can run it as
/Applications/Regina.app/Contents/MacOS/trisetcmp\&.
.SH "WINDOWS USERS"
.PP
The command-line utilities are installed beneath the
\fIProgram\~Files\fR directory; on some
machines this directory is called
\fIProgram\~Files\~(x86)\fR\&.
You can start this utility by running
c:\\Program\~Files\\Regina\\Regina\~7.4\\bin\\trisetcmp.exe\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP

of Regina; see the users' handbook for a full list of credits.
