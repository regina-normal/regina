.SH NAME
regconvert \- Convert between different Regina file formats
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBregconvert\fR [ \fB-x\fR | \fB-u\fR | \fB-b\fR ] \fB\fIold-file\fB\fR [ \fB\fInew-file\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Between \fBRegina\fR versions 2.4 and 3.0, the data files changed from
using an impenetrable and undocumented binary format to using
(optionally compressed) XML\&.
.PP
This utility simply converts back and forth between these different
file formats.
.PP
Argument \fIold-file\fR should be the file to
read and convert; argument \fInew-file\fR should
be the name of the new converted file to write.  These two filenames
may be the same, in which case the old file will be replaced with the new.
.PP
If argument \fInew-file\fR is missing, the new
file will be written to standard output; this forces output to be
uncompressed XML (see option \fB-u\fR).
.sp
.RS
.B "Warning:"
When writing an old-style binary file, some information might be
lost.  Specifically, only information that is understood by the
\fBRegina\fR\~2.4 calculation engine will be written.
