.SH NAME
regconvert \- Convert between different Regina file formats
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBregconvert\fR [ \fB-x\fR | \fB-u\fR ] \fB\fIold-file\fB\fR [ \fB\fInew-file\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This utility converts back and forth between different Regina
file formats.
.sp
.RS
.B "Note:"
As of September\~2013, the ancient binary file format that was
used with Regina\~2.x is no longer supported.
This format has not been in use for over a decade now.
If you still have files in this format, you will need to
download Regina\~4.93 to convert them.
.RE
.PP
The argument \fIold-file\fR should be the file to
read and convert; the argument \fInew-file\fR should
be the name of the new converted file to write.  These two filenames
may be the same, in which case the old file will be replaced with the new.
.PP
If the argument \fInew-file\fR is missing then the
new file will be written to standard output, which forces the output to be
uncompressed XML (see option \fB-u\fR).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-x (default)\fR
Convert to compressed XML\&.
.TP
\fB-u\fR
Convert to plain (uncompressed) XML\&.
