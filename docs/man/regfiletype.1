.SH NAME
regfiletype \- Identify the formats of Regina data files
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBregfiletype\fR \fB\fIfile\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This utility determines which file format a given
Regina data file is in.
You may pass multiple files on the command line; the format of each
file will be written to standard output.
.PP
Only Regina's modern XML-based file formats are recognised
(both compressed and uncompressed).
In its very early years, Regina used an impenetrable and undocumented
binary format; this was replaced with XML in 2002 (Regina\~3.0),
and support for this format was removed completely in 2013
(Regina\~4.94).
If you still need to recognise and/or read files in this ancient binary
format, you will need to download Regina\~4.93.
.SH "MACOS\\~X USERS"
.PP
If you downloaded a drag-and-drop app bundle, this utility is
shipped inside it.  If you dragged Regina to the main
Applications folder, you can run it as
/Applications/Regina.app/Contents/MacOS/regfiletype\&.
.SH "WINDOWS USERS"
.PP
The command-line utilities are installed beneath the
\fIProgram\~Files\fR directory; on some
machines this directory is called
\fIProgram\~Files\~(x86)\fR\&.
You can start this utility by running
c:\\Program\~Files\\Regina\\Regina\~5.1\\bin\\regfiletype.exe\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP

.SH "AUTHOR"

This utility was written by Benjamin Burton

Many people have been involved in the development
of Regina; see the users' handbook for a full list of credits.
