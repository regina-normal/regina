.TH "TRICENSUS-MPI-STATUS" "1" "14 December 2016" "" "The Regina Handbook"

.SH NAME
tricensus-mpi-status \- Summarise the log file of an MPI census of triangulations
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBtricensus-mpi-status\fR \fB\fIlog-file\fB\fR

.SH "CAUTION"
.PP
The MPI utilities in Regina are deprecated, and will be removed from
Regina in a future release.
If you wish to parallelise the generation of a census, we recommend
splitting up the input pairing files into chunks, and using typical
queue systems (such as PBS) to parallelise.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This utility reads a log file produced by a
\fBtricensus-mpi\fR
job, and writes a human-readable summary to standard output.
It can be used for either jobs that have finished or jobs that are
still running, and it can happily read logs that have been
compressed using gzip or bzip2.
.PP
The logs produced by \fBtricensus-mpi\fR are very
detailed, including timestamps, details of which slaves have taken
which tasks, and how many triangulations each task has produced.
This utility distills this detailed log into an easy-to-read
summary, with one line for each face pairing.
.PP
Output will only appear for face pairings that have been
examined so far (which includes face pairings still being processed).
This output will include:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
whether processing for each face pairing has
finished;
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
the number of triangulations found so far for each
face pairing;
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
the number of subsearches generated and/or finished
for each face pairing (only relevant when running in subsearch
mode).
.PP
The final line of output will list the total number of triangulations
found so far, whether the census has finished, and if not, when the
last log entry was written.
.PP
For further explanation of the terminology used above, see the
\fBtricensus-mpi\fR
reference.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
See the
\fBtricensus-mpi\fR
reference for a sample session in which
\fBtricensus-mpi-status\fR is used.
.SH "MACOS\\~X AND WINDOWS USERS"
.PP
This utility is not shipped with the drag-and-drop app bundle for
\fBMacOS\~X\fR or with the \fBWindows\fR installer.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
