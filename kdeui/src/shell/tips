Each piece of information stored in a topology data file is called a
<i>packet</i>.  There are many different types of packets: containers,
triangulations, normal surface lists, text items and more.
<p>
Packets are arranged in a tree (displayed on the left hand side of the
main window), so each packet may store several other &quot;child packets&quot;
beneath it.  This allows you to keep large amounts of data together in a
single file in an organised fashion.

<p>
Changes that you make to a packet (such as a triangulation, a text
packet, a script, etc.) do not take effect until you commit them.
<p>
To commit your changes, press the <i>Commit</i> button at the bottom of
the packet editor.  If you close the packet editor or press the
<i>Discard</i> button, any changes since the last commit will be
discarded (you will be warned before this happens).
<p>
Note that some actions automatically commit your changes for you (examples
include several triangulation actions such as simplification, subdivision
and connected sum decomposition).

Regina comes with a full users' handbook, including an index of common
tasks.  You can read it by selecting <i>Regina Handbook</i> from
the <i>Help</i> menu, or by typing <tt>help:/regina</tt> directly into
Konqueror.

Regina ships with a number of sample files that give you an overview
of what Regina can do.  The file <tt>sample-misc.rga</tt> is an
excellent starting point.
<p>
These sample files are generally installed in
<tt>/usr/share/regina/examples</tt>,
<tt>/usr/local/share/regina/examples</tt>
or a similar path, depending on your distribution and how Regina was compiled.

Most user interface elements in Regina come with &quot;what's this&quot;
help.
<p>
To find out what a button, text box, list, menu item, etc. does,
select <i>What's This?</i> from the <i>Help</i> menu and click on whatever
object you are curious about.

If you wish to remember what role a tetrahedron plays within a
triangulation, you can name it.
<p>
In the <i>Gluings</i> tab of the triangulation editor, double click
in the <i>Tetrahedron</i> column and start typing to give a tetrahedron
a name.  Regina will also assign it a tetrahedron number as usual.

If you find it difficult searching through lists of normal surfaces,
you can create a <i>surface filter</i>.  A surface filter lets you
restrict a list of surfaces so you only see surfaces with particular
properties (for instance, all closed orientable surfaces with Euler
characteristic zero).
<p>
To create a new surface filter, select <i>New Filter</i> from the
<i>Packet Tree</i> menu.  In the dialog that appears, select <i>Filter
by properties</i> and then enter in your particular constraints.

<p>
Once a triangulation has a normal surface list or an angle structure
list beneath it, the triangulation cannot be changed (since changing
the triangulation would invalidate the normal surfaces and angle
structures).
<p>
If you wish to edit such a triangulation, try cloning it through the
<i>Packet Tree</i> menu.  The clone will not have any children beneath
it and may be edited freely.

<p>
If you wish to mark a particular normal surface within a list so that
you can find it again later, you can give it a name.
<p>
Simply double click in the empty <i>Name</i> field in the table of
surfaces and start typing.  Don't forget to commit your changes!

You can combine several surface filters using boolean AND or OR.
This is done using <i>combination filters</i>.
<p>
Select <i>New Filter</i> from the <i>Packet Tree</i> menu, and in
the dialog that appears select <i>Combination filter</i>.
This filter will then combine all of the filters immediately
beneath it in the packet tree.
<p>
So, for instance, to create a filter that captures 2-spheres and
tori, create a new combination filter that uses boolean OR.  Beneath
this combination filter, create two property filters: one that captures
closed orientable surfaces with Euler characteristic two, and one that
captures closed orientable surfaces with Euler characteristic zero.

Regina ships with several command-line utilities for manipulating data
files and running long census calculations.  See the
<i>Specialised Utilities</i> section of the users' handbook for details.

There are two ways of editing the gluings between tetrahedron faces.
<p>
Impatient users can use <i>direct edit</i> mode, where you type a
string such as <tt>1&nbsp;(201)</tt> directly into the table.
New users might prefer <i>pop-up dialog</i> mode, where you double-click
on a table cell to bring up a dialog box instead.
<p>
You can switch between modes through Regina's settings, by selecting
<i>Triangulation Options</i> and looking for <i>Edit mode</i>.

If you use Regina's python interface and you find yourself writing the same
code over and over again, you can put this code in a <i>python library</i>.
<p>
A python library is simply a text file (usually containing function
definitions) that is executed at the beginning of each python session.
<p>
To add a new python library, simply open Regina's settings,
select <i>Python Options</i> and add your file to the list.

You can embed PDF documents directly into Regina data files.  This
allows you to document your work using not just plain text but also
diagrams and typeset equations.
<p>
To do this, create your PDF document using your favourite word processor
or typesetting system (such as LaTeX).  Then select <i>New PDF Document</i>
from the <i>Packet Tree</i> menu, where you can browse the filesystem and
import your PDF document into the current Regina data file.
