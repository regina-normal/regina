/**
 * Represents a 2-tangle in the 3-ball.  Regina does not allow closed
 * components in a tangle; in other words, a tangle in Regina is a
 * proper embedding of exactly two arcs in the 3-ball with the
 * corresponding four endpoints attached to four marked points on
 * the 3-ball boundary.
 *
 * Regina stores tangles as projections, with the four endpoints
 * fixed at the top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right
 * corners of the diagram.
 *
 * Each tangles has a _type_, indicating how the four endpoints are
 * connected.  The three possible types are:
 *
 * - _horizontal_, indicating that the two top endpoints are connected,
 *   and the two bottom endpoints are connected;
 *
 * - _vertical_, indicating that the two left endpoints are connected,
 *   and the two right endpoints are connected;
 *
 * - _diagonal_, indicating that the top-left and bottom-right endpoints
 *   are connected, and the bottom-left and top-right endpoints are connected.
 *
 * Internally, Regina numbers the two strings 0 and 1: string 0 will
 * always be the one attached to the top-left endpoint.
 * Regina also assigns each string an orientation: for a
 * horizontal or diagonal tangle this will always be from left to right,
 * and for a vertical tangle this will always be from top to bottom.
 *
 * When traversing a tangle, if you reach one of the endpoints of a string
 * then the corresponding return value of Crossing::next() or
 * Crossing::prev() (whichever is relevant) will be a null strand reference.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.
