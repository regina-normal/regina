         *
         * The given arc \a from identifies the node to the left of the flype
         * disc.  The aim of this routine is to identify two suitable arcs
         * \a left and \a right that exit through the right of the flype
         * disc.  Together, these three arcs uniquely identify the entire
         * flype disc, and therefore prescribe the operation precisely.

         * - It is possible that there are _no_ suitable arcs \a left and
         *   \a right.  In this case, this routine returns a pair of null arcs.
         *
         * - It is possible that there is exactly one pair of suitable arcs
         *   (\a left, \a right).  In this case, this pair will be returned.
         *
         * - It is possible that there are _many_ pairs of suitable arcs.
         *   In this case, it can be shown that the suitable pairs have an
         *   ordering \a P_1, ..., \a P_k in which the flype disc for \a P_i
         *   is completely contained within the flype disc for \a P_j whenever
         *   \a i < \a j.  In this case, this routine returns the _smallest_
         *   pair \a P_1; that is, the pair (\a left, \a right) that gives
         *   the smallest possible flype disc.
         *
         * It should be noted that choosing only the smallest flype is not
         * a serious restriction: assuming the graph does not model a
         * composition of non-trivial knot diagrams, _any_ suitable flype

         *
         * The software \e plantri, by Gunnar Brinkmann and Brendan McKay,
         * can be used to enumerate 4-valent planar graphs (amongst many
         * other things).  This routine outputs this graph in a format
         * that mimics \e plantri's own dual ASCII format (i.e., the format
         * that \e plantri outputs when run with the flags `-adq`).
         *
         * Specifically, the output will be a comma-separated sequence
         * of alphabetical strings.  The <i>i</i>th such string will consist
         * of four letters, encoding the endpoints of the four edges in
         * clockwise order that leave node \a i.  The lower-case letters
         * \c a,\c b,...,\c z represent nodes 0,1,...,25 respectively,
         * and the upper-case letters \c A,\c B,...,\c Z represent nodes
         * 26,27,...,51 respectively.  An example of such a string is:
         *
           \verbatim
           bcdd,aeec,abfd,acfa,bffb,ceed
           \endverbatim
         *
         * For graphs with at most 26 nodes, this is identical to
         * \e plantri's own dual ASCII format.  For larger graphs, this
         * format differs: \e plantri uses punctuation to represent
         * higher-index nodes, whereas Regina uses upper-case letters.
         *
         * This routine is an inverse to fromPlantri(): for any graph \a g
         * that satisfies the preconditions below,
         * `fromPlantri(g.plantri())` is identical to \a g.  Likewise,
         * for any string \a s that satisfies the preconditions for
         * fromPlantri(), calling `fromPlantri(s).plantri()` will
         * recover the original string \a s.
         *
         * It is important to note the preconditions below: in particular,
         * that this graph must be dual to a _simple_ quadrangulation of
         * the sphere.  This is because the planar embeddings for more general
         * graphs (i.e., the duals of non-simple quadrangulations) cannot
         * always be uniquely reconstructed from their \e plantri output.
         *
         * \note The output of this function might not correspond to any
         * possible output from the program \e plantri itself, even if only
         * lower-case letters are used.  This is because \e plantri only
         * outputs graphs with a certain canonical labelling.  In contrast,
         * plantri() can be called on any graph that satisfies the
         * preconditions below, and it will preserve the labels of the nodes

         * and arcs, and with optional compression.
         *
         * This routine is similar to plantri(), but with two
         * significant differences:
         *
         * - This routine does not preserve the labelling of nodes and
         *   the order of arcs around each node.  Instead it reorders the
         *   nodes and arcs so that any two relabellings of the "same"
         *   planar embedding will produce the same canonicalPlantri() output.
         *   By "same" we allow for relabelling and isotopy (sliding the
         *   graph around the sphere); if the argument \a useReflection is
         *   \c true then we allow for reflection also.
         *
         * - If the argument \a tight is \c true, then this routine uses
         *   an abbreviated output format.  The resulting compression is
         *   only trivial (it reduces the length by roughly 40%), but
         *   the resulting string is still human-parseable (though with a
         *   little more effort required).  This compression will simply
         *   remove the commas, and for each node it will suppress the
         *   destination of the first arc (since this can be deduced from
         *   the canonical labelling).
         *
         * Regardless of whether \e tight is \c true or \c false, the
         * resulting string can be parsed by fromPlantri() to
         * reconstruct the original graph.  Note however that, due to
         * the canonical labelling, the resulting graph might be a
         * relabelling of the original (and might even be a reflection
         * of the original, if \a useReflection was passed as \c true).

         * differs from \e plantri's for graphs with more than 26 nodes.

         * that Regina can work with directly.
         *
         * If you are converting output from \e plantri, this output must be
         * in ASCII format, and must be the dual graph of a simple
         * quadrangulation of the sphere.  The corresponding flags that must

           \verbatim
           6 bbcd,adca,abee,affb,cffc,deed

         *
         * This function _only_ takes the comma-separated sequence of

         * identical for smaller graphs but which differs from \e plantri's
         * own output format for larger graphs.  In particular:
         *
         * - For graphs with ≤ 26 nodes, Regina and \e plantri use identical

         *   \e plantri as described above, as well as the output from
         *   Regina's own plantri() and canonicalPlantri() functions.
         *
         * - For graphs with 27-52 nodes, Regina's and \e plantri's formats
         *   differ: whereas \e plantri uses punctuation for higher-index
         *   nodes, Regina uses the upper-case letters \c A,...,\c Z.
         *   For these larger graphs, Regina can only recognise Regina's own
         *   plantri() and canonicalPlantri() output, not \e plantri's
         *   punctuation-based encodings.
         *
         * - For graphs with 53 nodes or more, Regina cannot encode or
         *   decode such graphs using \e plantri format at all.
         *
         * Even for graphs with at most 26 nodes, the given string does not
         * _need_ to be come from the program \e plantri itself.  Whereas
         * \e plantri always outputs graphs with a particular canonical
         * labelling, this function can accept an arbitrary ordering of nodes
         * and arcs - in particular, it can accept the string
         * `g.plantri()` for any graph \a g that meets the preconditions
         * below.  Nevertheless, the graph must still meet these preconditions,
         * since otherwise the \e plantri format might not be enough to
         * uniquely reconstruct the graph and its planar embedding.
         *
         * This routine can also interpret the "tight" format that is
         * optionally produced by the member function canonicalPlantri()
