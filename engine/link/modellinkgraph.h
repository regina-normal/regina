/**
 * Represents an undirected 4-valent graph with a specific embedding in some
 * closed orientable surface.  This class only stores the graph and a local
 * description of the embedding (i.e., a cyclic ordering of arcs around each
 * node).  It does not store the surface explicitly, though the surface is
 * implied from the embedding - if you need it you can always access a full
 * description of the surface by calling cells().
 *
 * In particular, the surface is assumed to be the minimal genus surface in
 * which the graph embeds.  Each connected component of the graph is embedded
 * in a separate connected component of the surface, and each component of the
 * surface is formed from a collection of discs (or _cells_) whose boundaries
 * follow the nodes and arcs of the graph according to the local embedding.
 *
 * Regina uses graphs like these as model graphs for classical or virtual link
 * diagrams, where each node of the graph becomes a classical crossing.
 * If the surface is a collection of 2-spheres, then the graph is planar and
 * models a _classical_ link diagram.  If the surface has genus, then the
 * graph is non-planar and instead models a _virtual_ link diagram.
 *
 * Currently this class does not support circular graph components (which,
 * in a link diagram, would correspond to zero-crossing unknot components
 * of the link).
 *
 * For Boost users: if you wish to study the underlying graph of an existing
 * link, you do not need to create a ModelLinkGraph - instead you can include
 * link/graph.h and then use Link directly as a directed graph type with the
 * Boost Graph Library.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.

         *
         * Specifically, the output will be a comma-separated sequence
         * of alphabetical strings.  The <i>i</i>th such string will consist
         * of four letters, encoding the endpoints of the four edges in

         * 26,27,...,51 respectively.  An example of such a string is:
         *
           \verbatim
           bcdd,aeec,abfd,acfa,bffb,ceed
           \endverbatim
         *
         * For graphs with at most 26 nodes, this is identical to
         * _plantri_'s own dual ASCII format.  For larger graphs, this
         * format differs: _plantri_ uses punctuation to represent
         * higher-index nodes, whereas Regina uses upper-case letters.
         *
         * Although _plantri_ is designed to work with graphs that are
         * connected and planar, this routine will happily produce output for
         * disconnected and/or non-planar graphs.  However, there remains an
         * unavoidable requirement: the graph must be dual to a _simple_
         * quadrangulation.  In detail:
         *
         * - The dual to this 4-valent graph will be a quadrangulation of the
         *   surface in which it embeds.  The _plantri_ format inherently
         *   requires that this quadrangulation is _simple_: that is,
         *   the dual must have no loops or parallel edges.
         *
         * - This requirement exists because, if the dual is _not_ simple, the
         *   embedding of the original graph cannot be uniquely reconstructed
         *   from its _plantri_ output.  In particular, the embedding becomes
         *   ambiguous around parallel edges in the original 4-valent graph.
         *
         * - For _planar_ graphs, this requirement is relatively harmless:
         *   a parity condition shows that loops in the dual are impossible,
         *   and parallel edges in the dual mean that any link diagram that
         *   this graph models is an "obvious" connected sum.
         *
         * - For _non-planar_ graphs, this requirement is more problematic.
         *   For example, consider the graph that models the virtual trefoil:
         *   the dual quadrangulation of the torus contains both loops and
         *   parallel edges.  This makes the _plantri_ format unusable in
         *   practice for graps that model virtual links.
         *
         * If this constraint is too onerous (e.g., you are working with
         * virtual links), you could use extendedPlantri() instead, which is
         * not compatible with the Brinkmann-McKay _plantri_ software but which
         * removes this requirement for the dual quadrangulation to be simple.
         *
         * For graphs that the _plantri_ format _does_ support, this routine
         * is an inverse to fromPlantri().  That is, for any graph \a g that
         * satisfies the preconditions below, `fromPlantri(g.plantri())` is
         * identical to \a g.  Likewise, for any string \a s that satisfies
         * the preconditions for fromPlantri(), calling
         * `fromPlantri(s).plantri()` will recover the original string \a s.
         *
         * \note The output of this function might not correspond to any
         * possible output from the program _plantri_ itself, even if the graph
         * is connected and planar, the dual quadrangulation is simple, and
         * only lower-case letters are used.  This is because _plantri_ only
         * outputs graphs with a certain canonical labelling.  In contrast,
         * plantri() can be called on any graph that satisfies the
         * preconditions below, and it will preserve the labels of the nodes

         *   \a allowReflection is \c true, optionally reversing the cyclic
         *   order of the arcs around _every_ node.  This corresponds to a
         *   homeomorphism between the surfaces in which the graphs embed that
         *   maps one graph to the other; the argument \a allowReflection
         *   indicates whether this homeomorphism is allowed to reverse
         *   orientation.  While this has a similar aim to canonical(), there
         *   is no promise that both routines will use the same "canonical
         *   relabelling".
         *
         * - If the argument \a tight is \c true, then this routine uses
         *   an abbreviated output format.  The resulting compression is
         *   only trivial (it reduces the length by roughly 40%), but
         *   the resulting string is still human-parseable (though with a
         *   little more effort required).  This compression will simply
         *   remove the commas, and for each node it will suppress the
         *   destination of the first arc (since this can be deduced from
         *   the canonical labelling).
         *
         * Regardless of whether \e tight is \c true or \c false, the
         * resulting string can be parsed by fromPlantri() to

         * The software _plantri_, by Gunnar Brinkmann and Brendan McKay,
         * can be used to enumerate 4-valent planar graphs (amongst many
         * other things).  This routine converts a piece of output from
         * _plantri_, or the encoding of a graph using Regina's more general
         * plantri() or canonicalPlantri() functions, into a ModelLinkGraph
         * object that Regina can work with directly.
         *
         * Graphs encoded using Regina's plantri() or canonicalPlantri()
         * functions may be disconnected and/or non-planar.  However, such a
         * graph must be dual to a simple quadrangulation of the surface in
         * which it embeds - otherwise the _plantri_ format does not contain
         * enough information to recover the embedding of the graph.  This in
         * particular is a problem for non-planar graphs (which model virtual
         * links).  If this is an issue for you, you can use Regina's
         * extended _plantri_ format instead; see extendedPlantri() and
         * fromExtendedPlantri().
         *
         * If you are working with output directly from the software _plantri_,
         * this output must be in ASCII format, and must likewise be the dual
         * graph of a simple quadrangulation of the sphere.  The flags that
         * must be passed to _plantri_ to obtain such output are `-adq`
         * (although you may wish to pass additional flags to expand or
         * restrict the classes of graphs that _plantri_ builds).
         *
         * When run with these flags, _plantri_ produces output in the
         * following form:
         *
           \verbatim
           6 bbcd,adca,abee,affb,cffc,deed
           6 bcdd,aeec,abfd,acfa,bffb,ceed
           6 bcde,affc,abfd,acee,addf,becb
           \endverbatim
         *
         * Each line consists of an integer (the number of nodes in the graph),
         * followed by a comma-separated sequence of alphabetical strings
         * that encode the edges leaving each node.
         *
         * This function _only_ takes the comma-separated sequence of
         * alphabetical strings.  So, for example, to construct the graph
         * corresponding to the second line of output above, you could call:
         *
         * \code{.cpp}
         * fromPlantri("bcdd,aeec,abfd,acfa,bffb,ceed");
         * \endcode
         *
         * Regina uses its own variant of _plantri_'s output format, which is
         * identical for smaller graphs but which differs from _plantri_'s
         * own output format for larger graphs.  In particular:
         *
         * - For graphs with ≤ 26 nodes, Regina and _plantri_ use identical
         *   formats.  Here Regina can happily recognise the output from
         *   _plantri_ as described above, as well as the output from
         *   Regina's own plantri() and canonicalPlantri() functions.
         *
         * - For graphs with 27-52 nodes, Regina's and _plantri_'s formats
         *   differ: whereas _plantri_ uses punctuation for higher-index
         *   nodes, Regina uses the upper-case letters `A,...,Z`.
         *   For these larger graphs, Regina can only recognise Regina's own
         *   plantri() and canonicalPlantri() output, not _plantri_'s
         *   punctuation-based encodings.
         *
         * - For graphs with 53 nodes or more, Regina cannot encode or
         *   decode such graphs using _plantri_ format at all.
         *
         * Note that, whilst the software _plantri_ always outputs graphs using
         * a particular canonical labelling, this function has no such
         * restriction: it can accept an arbitrary ordering of nodes and arcs -
         * in particular, it can accept the string `g.plantri()` for any graph
         * \a g that meets the preconditions below.
         *
         * This routine can also interpret the "tight" format that is
         * optionally produced by the member function canonicalPlantri()
         * (even though such output would certainly _not_ be produced by
         * the software _plantri_).  Note that, by design, the tight format
         * can only represented connected graphs.
         *
