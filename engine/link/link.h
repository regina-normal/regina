 *
 * - The arc referred to is the arc beginning at the given strand of the
 *   given crossing, and moving forwards along the orientation of the link
 *   to the next crossing.
 *
 * - A null reference is used to refer to an entire zero-crossing unknot
 *   component (as opposed to a typical arc which has well-defined start
 *   and end points).  Of course the link in question may not have such a
 *   component, or may have many such components; the behaviour of the
 *   code in such circumstances is documented in the individual routines
 *   that take arc references as arguments.
 *
 * - The increment and decrement operators, as well as next() and prev(),
 *   behave as expected: they follow the link forward and backward
 *   respectively along its orientation.
 *
 * These objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with std::swap(),
 * with no need for any specialised move operations or swap functions.

 * Represents a directed knot or link in the 3-sphere.

 * This class supports links with any number of components (including zero),
 * and it also supports components with no crossings (which form additional
 * unknot components of the overall link).
 *
 * Since Regina 7.0, this is no longer a "packet type" that can be
 * inserted directly into the packet tree.  Instead a Link is now a
 * standalone mathematatical object, which makes it slimmer and faster
 * for ad-hoc use.  The consequences of this are:
 *
 * - If you create your own Link, it will not have any of the usual packet
 *   infrastructure.  You cannot add it into the packet tree, and it will
 *   not support a label, tags, child/parent packets, and/or event listeners.
 *
 * - To include a Link in the packet tree, you must create a new
 *   PacketOf<Link>.  This \e is a packet type, and supports labels, tags,
 *   child/parent packets, and event listeners.  It derives from Link,
 *   and so inherits the full Link interface.
 *
 * - If you are adding new functions to this class that edit the link,
 *   you must still remember to create a ChangeEventSpan.  This will
 *   ensure that, if the link is being managed by a PacketOf<Link>,
 *   then the appropriate packet change events will be fired.
 *   All other events (aside from packetToBeChanged() and packetWasChanged()
 *   are managed directly by the PacketOf<Link> wrapper class.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.

         * This routine is only available for knots at the present time.
         * If this link has multiple (or zero) components, then this
         * routine will throw an exception (as described below).
         *
         * This routine iterates through all knot diagrams that can be reached
         * from this via Reidemeister moves, without ever exceeding
         * \a height additional crossings beyond the original number.
         * With the current implementation, these diagrams <b>could become
         * reflected and/or reversed</b>, and moreover each diagram will only be
         * considered once up to reflection and/or reversal; be aware that this
         * behaviour could change and/or become configurable in a future version
         * of Regina.
         *
         * For every such knot diagram (including this starting
         * diagram), this routine will call \a action (which must
         * be a function or some other callable object).
         *
         * - \a action must take the following initial argument(s).
         *   Either (a) the first argument must be a link (the precise type
         *   is discussed below), representing the knot diagram that has been
         *   found; or else (b) the first two arguments must be of types
         *   const std::string& followed by a link, representing both the
         *   knot diagram and its knot signature.
         *   The second form is offered in order to avoid unnecessarily
         *   recomputation within the \a action function.
         *   If there are any additional arguments supplied in the list \a args,
         *   then these will be passed as subsequent arguments to \a action.
         *
         * - The link argument will be passed as an rvalue; a typical action
         *   could (for example) take it by const reference and query it,
         *   or take it by value and modify it, or take it by rvalue reference
         *   and move it into more permanent storage.
         *
         * - \a action must return a boolean.  If \a action ever returns
         *   \c true, then this indicates that processing should stop
         *   immediately (i.e., no more knot diagrams will be processed).
         *
         * - \a action may, if it chooses, make changes to this knot
         *   (i.e., the original knot upon which rewrite() was called).
         *   This will not affect the search: all knot diagrams
         *   that this routine visits will be obtained via Reidemeister moves
         *   from the original knot diagram, before any subsequent changes
         *   (if any) were made.
         *
         * - \a action will only be called once for each knot diagram
         *   (including this starting diagram).  In other words, no
         *   knot diagram will be revisited a second time in a single call
         *   to rewrite().
         *
         * This routine can be very slow and very memory-intensive, since the
         * number of knot diagrams it visits may be exponential in
         * the number of crossings, and it records every knot diagram
         * that it visits (so as to avoid revisiting the same diagram
         * again).  It is highly recommended that you begin with \a height = 1,
         * and if necessary try increasing \a height one at a time until
         * this routine becomes too expensive to run.
         *
         * If \a height is negative, then there will be \e no bound on
         * the number of additional crossings.  This means that the
         * routine will <i>never terminate</i>, unless \a action returns
         * \c true for some knot diagram that is passed to it.
         *
         * Since Regina 7.0, this routine will not return until the exploration
         * of knot diagrams is complete, regardless of whether a progress

         * never be calling \a action at the same time); as a corollary, the
         * action should avoid expensive operations where possible (otherwise
         * it will become a serialisation bottleneck in the multithreading).

         *   allowing for reflections).
         *
         * - Parsing a Gauss code is complex, since it requires an embedding

         * If you need a code that specifies the knot uniquely and/or that
         * is fast to parse, consider using the \e oriented Gauss code instead,
         * which resolves both of these issues.
         *
         * A Gauss code for an <i>n</i>-crossing knot is described by
         * a sequence of 2<i>n</i> positive and negative integers,
         * representing strands that pass over and under crossings
         * respectively.  The code is constructed as follows:
         *
         * - Label the crossings arbitrarily as 1, 2, ..., \a n.
         *
         * - Start at some point on the knot and follow it around.
         *   Whenever you pass crossing \a k, write the integer
         *   <tt><i>k</i></tt> if you pass over the crossing,
         *   or <tt>-<i>k</i></tt> if you pass under the crossing.
         *
         * As an example, you can represent the trefoil using the code:

         * Returns a planar diagram code for this link, presented as a string.

         * Planar diagram codes encode the local information at each
         * crossing, and present this information as a list of 4-tuples.
         * These codes are available for links as well as knots, but they do
         * come with some minor restrictions:
         *
         * - They cannot encode zero-crossing unknot components (i.e.,
         *   components for which the component() function returns a null
         *   strand).  Any such components will simply be omitted from the code.
         *
         * - If a link has any components that consist entirely of
         *   over-crossings (which must be unknots "placed on top of" the link
         *   diagram), a planar diagram code does not carry enough data to
         *   reconstruct the \e orientation of these components.  The topology
         *   will be preserved, but in general the combinatorics of such a link
         *   diagram cannot be reconstructed faithfully.
         *
         * If you need a text code that can work with these types of
         * link diagrams, you can always use Jenkins' format instead.
         *
         * Regina adheres to a tight specification for the planar diagram codes
         * that it outputs, in order to ensure compatibility with other
         * software.  In particular, Regina's codes are compatible with the
         * Knot Atlas, as seen at http://katlas.org/wiki/Planar_Diagrams .
         *
         * In detail: a planar diagram code for an <i>n</i>-crossing link
         * is formed from a sequence of <i>n</i> 4-tuples of integers.
         * Regina constructs this sequence as follows:
         *
         * - Throw away any zero-crossing unknot components.
         *
         * - Let \a n denote the number of crossings.
         *
         * - Number the strands from 1 to 2<i>n</i> in order as we walk along
         *   each component, in order from the first component to the last.
         *
         * - For each crossing \a c, construct a 4-tuple that lists the four
         *   strands that meet at that \a c, in counter-clockwise order,
         *   beginning from the incoming lower strand.
         *
         * - Return the resulting list of \a n 4-tuples.
         *
         * An example, you can represent the right-hand trefoil using the code:
         *
           \verbatim
           [[1, 5, 2, 4], [3, 1, 4, 6], [5, 3, 6, 2]]
           \endverbatim
         *
         * Some points to be aware of:
         *
         * - When building the list of 4-tuples, Regina orders the
         *   crossings as follows: again we walk along each component,
         *   in order from the first component to the last, and process
         *   each crossing when we enter it at the lower strand.
         *
         * - When building each individual 4-tuple, some sources order the
         *   strands clockwise instead of counter-clockwise.  Regina follows
         *   the same counter-clockwise convention that is used by the
         *   Knot Atlas and SnapPy.
         *
         * This routine formats the list of 4-tuples as a string, in a way
         * that is consistent with the description in the Knot Atlas at
         * http://katlas.org/wiki/Planar_Diagrams .
         *
         * In particular, each 4-tuple will be formatted with square
         * brackets, commas, and the prefix \c X, and the main list will
         * be formatted with square brackets, commas, and the prefix \c PD.
         * An example (for the right-handed trefoil) is:
         *
           \verbatim
           PD[X[1, 5, 2, 4], X[3, 1, 4, 6], X[5, 3, 6, 2]]
           \endverbatim
         *
         * The routine pdData() returns this same data in machine-readable
         * format (as a C++ vector of 4-tuples of integers), instead of the
         * human-readable format used here (a single string).  There is also
         * another variant of pd() that writes directly to an output stream.

         * Classical Gauss codes essentially describe the 4-valent graph
         * of a knot but not the particular embedding in the plane.  As
         * a result, there can be topological ambiguities when a knot is
         * reconstructed from a gauss code; these are described in the
         * warnings below.
         *
         * The Gauss code for an <i>n</i>-crossing knot is described by
         * a sequence of 2<i>n</i> positive and negative integers.
         * As an example, you can construct the trefoil using the code:
         *
           \verbatim
           1 -2 3 -1 2 -3
           \endverbatim

         * See gauss() for a full description of classical Gauss codes as
         * they are used in Regina, as well as their limitations.
         *
         * Regina imposes the following restrictions when reconstructing
         * a knot from a classical Gauss code:
         *
         * - This can only be done for knots (i.e., links with exactly one
         *   component).
         *
         * - The crossings of the knot must be labelled 1, 2, ..., \a n
         *   (i.e., they cannot be arbitrary natural numbers with "gaps",
         *   and the numbering cannot use a different starting point).
         *
         * Be aware that, once the knot has been constructed, the crossings
         * 1, ..., \a n will have been reindexed as 0, ..., <i>n</i>-1
         * (since every Link object numbers its crossings starting from 0).
         *
         * There are two variants of this routine.  This variant takes a
         * single string, where the integers have been combined together and
         * separated by whitespace.  The other variant takes a sequence of
         * integers, defined by a pair of iterators.
         *
         * In this variant (the string variant), the exact form of the
         * whitespace does not matter, and additional whitespace at the
         * beginning or end of the string is allowed.
         *
         * \warning In general, the classical Gauss code does not contain
         * enough information to uniquely reconstruct a knot.  For prime knots,
         * both a knot and its reflection can be described by the same Gauss

         * reflection.  If you need to reconstruct a knot uniquely, consider
         * using the \e oriented Gauss code instead.

         * Creates a new knot from either alphabetical or numerical
         * Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation, presented as a string.
         *
         * Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation essentially describes the 4-valent
         * graph of a knot but not the particular embedding in the plane.
         * As a result, there can be topological ambiguities when a knot is
         * reconstructed from Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation; these are
         * described in the warnings below.
         *
         * Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation comes in two forms: numerical
         * and alphabetical.  For an <i>n</i>-crossing knot, the numerical
         * form is a sequence of \a n even signed integers, and the
         * alphabetical form is a sequence of \a n case-sensitive letters.
         * As an example, you can construct the trefoil using either of
         * the following strings:
         *
           \verbatim
           4 6 2
           bca
           \endverbatim
         *
         * See dt(bool) for a full description of Dowker-Thistlethwaite
         * notation as it is used in Regina, as well as its limitations.
         *
         * There are two variants of this routine.  This variant takes a single
         * string, which is either (i) the alphabetical notation, in which any
         * whitespace within the string will be ignored; or (ii) the numerical
         * notation, in which the integers are combined together and
         * separated by whitespace.  The other variant of this routine
         * is only for numerical Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation, and it takes
         * a sequence of integers defined by a pair of iterators.
         *
         * In this variant (the string variant), the string may
         * contain additional leading or trailing whitespace; moreover,
         * for numerical Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation, the exact form
         * of the whitespace that separates the integers does not matter.
         *
         * \warning In general, Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation does not contain
         * enough information to uniquely reconstruct a knot.  For prime knots,
         * both a knot and its reflection can be described by the same notation;
         * for composite knots, the same notation can describe knots that are
         * topologically inequivalent, even when allowing for reflection.
         * If you need to reconstruct a knot uniquely, consider
         * using the oriented Gauss code instead.

         *
         * See pd() for a full description of planar diagram codes (and

         *
         * Regina imposes the following restrictions when reconstructing
         * a link from a planar diagram code:
         *
         * - The integers used in the input sequence (which denote the
         *   2<i>n</i> strands in the link diagram) must be in the range
         *   1, 2, ..., 2<i>n</i>.  That is, they cannot be arbitrary natural
         *   numbers with "gaps", and the numbering of strands cannot use a
         *   different starting point.
         *
         * When Regina builds the resulting link, it numbers the crossings
         * and components (but not the strands).  It will do this as follows:
         *
         * - Each 4-tuple in the given sequence represents a single crossing.
         *   Regina will number the crossings 0, 1, ..., \a n in the same
         *   order as the corresponding 4-tuples appear in the sequence.
         *
         * - The integers in the given sequence represent strands in the
         *   link diagram.  The strand numbered 1 will become the starting
         *   point of component 0 in the final link.  Of the strands not
         *   in that component, the lowest numbered strand remaining
         *   will become the starting point of component 1, and so on.
         *
         * - In particular be aware that StrandRef::id() will in general
         *   have no relation to the strand numbers used in the planar
         *   diagram code.
         *
         * There are two variants of this routine.  This variant takes a
         * single string containing all 4<i>n</i> integers (see below
         * for how this string may be formatted).  The other variant takes a
         * sequence of 4-tuples of integers, defined by a pair of iterators.
         *
         * In this variant (the string variant), the integers may be
         * separated by any combination of the following:
         *
         * - any whitespace;
         * - commas;
         * - open or close round brackets, square brackets and/or braces;
         * - the special symbols \c PD, \c X, \c Xp, \c Xm and \c P, which are
         *   used by other sources (such as the Knot Atlas), but which
         *   are ignored here.
         *
         * Thus the following strings all describe the same sequence:
         *
           \verbatim
           [[1, 5, 2, 4], [3, 1, 4, 6], [5, 3, 6, 2]]

           \endverbatim
         *
         * The string may containin separators (as defined above) at the
         * beginning and/or the end; these will be ignored.
         *
         * Note that some sources (again, such as the Knot Atlas) use the
         * special symbols \c Xp, \c Xm and \c P to change the meaning of the
         * tuples.  Regina does \e not attribute any meaning to these symbols,
         * and will treat them as nothing more than separators.
