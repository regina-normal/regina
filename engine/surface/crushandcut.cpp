/**
 * The bulk of this file contains the implementation for cutAlong(),
 * which cuts along a normal surface.
 *
 * The way this routine operates is as follows:
 *
 * - We add an extra set of vertex links to the original normal surface.  We
 *   refer to the regions inside these vertex links as "vertex neighbourhoods".
 *   These neighbourhoods are typically balls (though around ideal vertices
 *   they are cones over the corresponding boundary surfaces).
 *
 * - If we cut along the new normal surface, each tetrahedron falls
 *   apart into the following types of blocks:
 *
 *   + Triangular prisms, represented by the class TriPrism.  There are
 *     four types of triangular prism, corresponding to the four triangular
 *     normal disc types that bound them.
 *
 *   + Quadrilateral prisms, represented by the class QuadPrism.  There
 *     are three types of quadrilateral prism, corresponding to the
 *     three quadrilateral normal disc types that bound them.
 *
 *   + Tetrahedra truncated at all four vertices, represented by the
 *     class TruncTet.  There is only one type of truncated tetrahedron.
 *
 *   + Truncated half-tetrahedra, obtained by slicing a truncated
 *     tetrahedron along a quadrilateral normal disc and keeping one of
 *     the two halves that results.  This is represented by the class
 *     TruncHalfTet.  There are six types of truncated half-tetrahedra,
 *     corresponding to the three choices of "slicing quadrilateral" and
 *     the two choices of which half to keep.
 *
 *   The reason we add the extra vertex links is to keep this list of
 *   block types small; otherwise we must also deal with _partially_
 *   truncated tetrahedra and half-tetrahedra.
 *
 * - We triangulate each of the blocks.  There are two types of boundary
 *   for each block:  (i) boundary faces that run along the normal
 *   surface, and (ii) boundary faces that run along the joins between
 *   adjacent tetrahedra.  Faces (i) can be left alone (they will become
 *   the boundary of the final triangulation); faces (ii) need to be
 *   joined together according to how the original tetrahedra were
 *   joined together.  Note that a handful of type (i) boundary faces
 *   run along the extra vertex links, and so these will be glued back
 *   onto the missing vertex neighbourhoods at the end of the cutting
 *   procedure.
 *
 * - For each block, we organise the boundaries of type (ii) into
 *   quadrilaterals and hexagons (each of which is the intersection of
 *   the block with a single face of the enclosing tetrahedron).  These
 *   are represented by the classes BdryQuad and BdryHex respectively.
 *
 * - The overall cutting algorithm then works as follows:
 *
 *   + Triangulate each block.  The class TetBlockSet represents a full
 *     set of triangulated blocks within a single tetrahedron of the
 *     original triangulation.
 *
 *   + Glue together the type (ii) boundaries between adjacent blocks,
 *     using layerings as needed to make the triangulated quadrilaterals
 *     and hexagons compatible.
 *
 *   + Construct the missing vertex neighbourhoods and glue them back onto
 *     the appropriate type (i) block boundaries.
 *
 * See the individual classes for further details.
