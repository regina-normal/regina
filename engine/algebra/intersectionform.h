 * Represents a symmetric bilinear integral form, which for Regina is
 * typically the intersection form of a 4-manifold.
 *
 * Such a bilinear form is stored as a symmetric square integer matrix.  For
 * closed 4-manifolds, this matrix is unimodular; however, this class can also
 * represent more general bilinear forms (including degenerate forms).
 *
 * The main thing that this class provides in addition to the square matrix is
 * access to invariants of the bilinear form, including rank, signature, and
 * type (even vs odd).  All of these invariants are computed by the class
 * constructor, and so querying them via routines such as rank(), signature(),
 * even() or odd() is essentially instantaneous.
