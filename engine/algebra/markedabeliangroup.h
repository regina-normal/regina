/**
 * Represents a finitely generated abelian group given by a chain complex.
 *
 * This class is initialized with a chain complex.  The chain complex is given
 * in terms of two integer matrices \a M and \a N such that M*N=0. The abelian
 * group is the kernel of \a M mod the image of \a N.
 *
 * In other words, we are computing the homology of the chain complex
 * <tt>Z^a --N--> Z^b --M--> Z^c</tt>
 * where a=N.columns(), M.columns()=b=N.rows(), and c=M.rows().  An additional
 * constructor allows one to take the homology with coefficients in an arbitrary
 * cyclic group.
 *
 * This class allows one to retrieve the invariant factors, the rank, and
 * the corresponding vectors in the kernel of \a M.  Moreover, given a
 * vector in the kernel of \a M, it decribes the homology class of the
 * vector (the free part, and its position in the invariant factors).
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to allow one to not only
 * represent homology groups, but it gives coordinates on the group allowing
 * for the construction of homomorphisms, and keeping track of subgroups.
 *
 * Some routines in this class refer to the internal <i>presentation
 * matrix</i>.  This is a proper presentation matrix for the abelian group,
 * and is created by constructing the product MRBi() * \a N, and then
 * removing the first rankM() rows.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.

 *
 * So for example, if the domain was initialized by the chain complex

 * was initialized by <tt>Z^d --D--> Z^e --E--> Z^f</tt> with mod q

 * assumes but which the user can confirm with isCycleMap(). Moreover,
 * \a q should divide \a p: this allows for \a q > 0 and \a p = 0,

 * pleasant way to make it empty.  Or we could have a variety of routines
 * among these themes.  Store some minimal data for efficient computations of
 * preImage, eventually replacing the internals of inverseHom() with a more
 * flexible set of tools. Also add an isInImage() in various coordinates.
 *
 * \todo \optlong writeTextShort() have completely different set of

 * projection, differential, finite order, etc.
