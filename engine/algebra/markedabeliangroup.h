class HomMarkedAbelianGroup;

/**
 * Represents a finitely generated abelian group given by a chain complex.
 *
 * This class is initialized with a chain complex.  The chain complex is given
 * in terms of two integer matrices \a M and \a N such that M*N=0.  These
 * matrices should be thought of as acting on column vectors: this means for
 * example that the product <tt>B*A</tt> applies the linear transformation
 * \a A, then the linear transformation \a B.  This is consistent with the
 * convention that Regina uses for for multiplying permutations.
 *
 * The abelian group that this class computes is the kernel of \a M modulo the
 * image of \a N.  In other words, we compute the homology of the chain complex
 * <tt>Z^a --N--> Z^b --M--> Z^c</tt>,
 * where \a a = N.columns(), \a b = M.columns() = N.rows(), and \a c = M.rows().
 * An additional constructor allows you to take the homology with coefficients
 * in an arbitrary cyclic group.
 *
 * Like the simpler class AbelianGroup, this group will be isomorphic to some
 * <tt>Z_{d0} + ... + Z_{dk} + Z^r</tt>, where:
 *
 * - \a r is the number of free generators, as returned by rank();
 *
 * - \a d1, ..., \a dk are the <i>invariant factors</i> that describe the
 *   torsion elements of the group, where 1 < \a d1 | \a d2 | ... | \a dk.
 *
 * This class allows you to retrieve the invariant factors, the rank, and
 * the corresponding vectors in the kernel of \a M.  Moreover, given a
 * vector in the kernel of \a M, it decribes the homology class of the
 * vector (the free part, and its position in the invariant factors).
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to not just represent homology groups, but
 * also to support coordinates on the group allowing for the construction of
 * homomorphisms, and keeping track of subgroups.
 *
 * This routine makes frequent use of two coordinate systems:
 *
 * - <i>Chain complex coordinates</i> describe vectors of length \a b
 *   (using the notation above); that is, elements of the domain of \a M,
 *   or equivalently the codomain of \a N.
 *
 * - <i>SNF (or Smith normal form) coordinates</i> describe elements of this
 *   abelian group in terms of the torsion and free generators.  A vector in
 *   SNF coordinates has length (\a k + \a r), again using the notation above,
 *   where the first \a k elements store coefficients for the generators of the
 *   torsion components Z_{d1}, ..., Z_{dk}, and the remaining \a r elements
 *   store coefficients for the \a r free generators.  You can see how the
 *   torsion and free generators appear in chain complex coordinates by
 *   calling torsionRep() or freeRep() respectively.
 *
 * Be aware that the choice of torsion and free generators is typically
 * not unique, and this will affect the results of many member functions of
 * this class.  These choices are subject to change between different versions
 * of Regina; in particular, they depend upon the particular algorithm
 * used for computing Smith normal forms.
 *
 * Some routines in this class refer to the <i>internal presentation
 * matrix</i>.  This is a proper presentation matrix for the abelian group;
 * if you are looking at the implementation details, this refers to the
 * matrix \a pres, created by taking the product <tt>MRi_ * N</tt> and then
 * removing the first \a rankM_ rows.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.
 *
 * @author Ryan Budney and B.B.
 *
 * \todo \optlong Look at using sparse matrices for storage of SNF and the like.

 *   via homology with coefficients, the codomain coefficients must be a
 *   quotient of the domain coefficients.
 *
 * So for example, if the domain was initialized by the chain complex
 * <tt>Z^a --A--> Z^b --B--> Z^c</tt> with mod p coefficients, and the codomain
 * was initialized by <tt>Z^d --D--> Z^e --E--> Z^f</tt> with mod q

 * Furthermore, you only obtain a well-defined

 * assumes but which the user can confirm with isCycleMap(). Moreover,
 * \a q should divide \a p: this allows for \a q > 0 and \a p = 0,
 * which means the domain has Z coefficients and the codomain has mod \a q
 * coefficients.

 * pleasant way to make it empty.  Or we could have a variety of routines
 * among these themes.  Store some minimal data for efficient computations of
 * preImage, eventually replacing the internals of inverseHom() with a more
 * flexible set of tools. Also add an isInImage() in various coordinates.
 *
 * \todo \optlong writeTextShort() have completely different set of

 * projection, differential, finite order, etc.
