 * that are independent of the underlying coordinate system.  Thus the
 * coordinates of the normal surface in any coordinate system can be
 * determined without knowledge of the specific underlying coordinate
 * system being used.
 *
 * Note that non-compact surfaces (surfaces with infinitely many discs,
 * such as spun-normal surfaces) are allowed; in these cases, the
 * corresponding coordinate lookup routines should return
 * LargeInteger::infinity where appropriate.
 *
 * All subclasses of NormalSurfaceVector <b>must</b> have the following
 * properties:
 *
 * - Normal surfaces can be enumerated by intersecting the non-negative
 *   orthant of the underlying vector space with some linear subspace;
 *
 * - Adding two normal surfaces corresponds to adding the two underlying
 *   vectors.
 *
 * <b>When deriving classes from NormalSurfaceVector:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A new value must must be added to the NormalCoords enum in
 *   normalcoords.h to represent the new coordinate system (do not
 *   forget to add this constant to the python bindings also).</li>
 *   <li>The file coordregistry-impl.h must be updated to reflect the new
 *   coordinate system (the file itself contains instructions
 *   on how to do this).</li>
 *   <li>A corresponding specialisation of NormalInfo<> must be
 *   defined, typically in the same header as the new vector subclass.</li>
 *   <li>The macro REGINA_NORMAL_SURFACE_FLAVOUR must be added to the
 *   beginning of the new vector subclass.  This will declare and define
 *   various constants, typedefs and virtual functions (see the
 *   REGINA_NORMAL_SURFACE_FLAVOUR macro documentation for details).</li>
 *   <li>Constructors <tt>class(size_t length)</tt> and
 *   <tt>class(const Vector<LargeInteger>& cloneMe)</tt> must be
 *   declared and implemented; these will usually just call the
 *   corresponding superclass constructors.</li>
 *   <li>All abstract functions must be implemented, except for those
 *   already provided by REGINA_NORMAL_SURFACE_FLAVOUR.
 *   Note that coordinate functions such as triangles() must return the
 *   \e total number of discs of the requested type; if your new coordinate
 *   system adorns discs with extra information (such as orientation) then
 *   your implementation must compute the appropriate sum.</li>
 *   <li>The orientation-specific coordinate functions
 *   orientedTriangles() and orientedQuads() must be
 *   implemented if your coordinate system supports transverse orientation.
 *   Otherwise you can use the default implementations (which returns zero).
