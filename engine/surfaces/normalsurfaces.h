/**
 * A collection of normal surfaces in a 3-manifold triangulation.
 *
 * There are some important changes to this class as of Regina 7.0:
 *
 * - A normal surface list does \e not need to be a child packet of the
 *   underlying triangulation, and indeed does not need to interact with
 *   the packet tree at all.
 *
 * - You are welcome to modify or even destroy the original triangulation;
 *   if you do then this list will automatically make a private copy of the
 *   original triangulation as an ongoing reference.  Different normal
 *   surface lists (and angle structure lists) can all share the same
 *   private copy, so this is not an expensive process.
 *
 * - You should now create normal surface lists using the class constructor
 *   (but which, unlike the old enumerate(), does not insert the list
 *   into the packet tree).  There is no need to use enumerate() any more.
 *
 * Since Regina 7.0, this is no longer a "packet type" that can be
 * inserted directly into the packet tree.  Instead a normal surface list
 * is now a standalone mathematatical object, which makes it slimmer and
 * faster for ad-hoc use.  The consequences of this are:
 *
 * - If you create your own NormalSurfaces object, it will not have any of
 *   the usual packet infrastructure.  You cannot add it into the packet tree,
 *   and it will not support a label, tags, child/parent packets, and/or
 *   event listeners.
 *
 * - To include an NormalSurfaces object in the packet tree, you must create
 *   a new PacketOf<NormalSurfaces>.  This \e is a packet type, and supports
 *   labels, tags, child/parent packets, and event listeners.  It derives from
 *   NormalSurfaces, and so inherits the full NormalSurfaces interface.
 *
 * - If you are adding new functions to this class that edit the list,
 *   you must still remember to create a ChangeEventSpan.  This will
 *   ensure that, if the list is being managed by a PacketOf<NormalSurfaces>,
 *   then the appropriate packet change events will be fired.
 *   All other events (aside from packetToBeChanged() and packetWasChanged()
 *   are managed directly by the PacketOf<NormalSurfaces> wrapper class.
 *
 * See the NormalSurface class notes for details of what to do
 * when introducing a new coordinate system.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.
 *
 * \todo \feature Allow custom matching equations.
 * \todo \feature Allow enumeration with some coordinates explicitly set
 * to zero.
 * \todo \feature Allow generating only closed surfaces.
 * \todo \feature Generate facets of the solution space representing
 * embedded surfaces.

         * A unified "enumeration constructor" for enumerating various classes
         * of normal surfaces within a given triangulation.
         *
         * The NormalCoords argument allows you to specify an underlying
         * coordinate system in which to do the enumeration (e.g., standard
         * coordinates, quadrilateral coordinates or almost normal coordinates).
         * This choice of coordinate system will affect which surfaces are
         * produced, since vertex/fundamental surfaces in one system are not
         * necessarily vertex/fundamental in another.
         *
         * The NormalList argument is a combination of flags that
         * allows you to specify exactly which normal surfaces you require.
         * This includes (i) whether you want all vertex surfaces
         * or all fundamental surfaces, which defaults to NS_VERTEX
         * if you specify neither or both; and (ii) whether you want only
         * properly embedded surfaces or you also wish to include
         * immersed and/or singular surfaces, which defaults to
         * NS_EMBEDDED_ONLY if you specify neither or both.
         *
         * The NormalAlg argument is a combination of flags that allows
         * you to control the underlying enumeration algorithm.  These
         * flags are treated as hints only: if your selection of
         * algorithm is invalid, unavailable or unsupported then Regina
         * will choose something more appropriate.  Unless you have
         * some specialised need, the default NS_ALG_DEFAULT (which
         * makes no hints at all) will allow Regina to choose what it
         * thinks will be the most efficient method.
         *
         * The enumerated surfaces will be stored in this new normal
         * surface list, and their representations will be scaled down
         * to use the smallest possible integer coordinates.
         *
         * Unlike the old enumerate() function, the new normal surface
         * list will \e not be inserted into the packet tree.  Moreover,
         * the given triangulation may change or even be destroyed
         * without causing problems.  See the class notes for details.
         *
         * If a progress tracker is passed, this routine will declare and
         * work through a series of stages whose combined weights sum to 1;
         * typically this means that the given tracker must not have been
         * used before.
         *
         * This constructor will not return until the enumeration of surfaces
         * is complete, regardless of whether a progress tracker was passed.
         * If you need the behaviour of the old enumerate() (where passing a
         * progress tracker caused the enumeration to start in the background),
         * simply call this constructor in a new detached thread.
         * Note that this enumeration can be extremely slow for larger
         * triangulations, and so there could be good reasons to do this.
         *
         * If an error occurs, then this routine will thrown an exception.
         * In this case, no normal surface list will be created, and the
         * progress tracker (if passed) will be marked as finished.
         * See the exception specifications below for details.
         *
         * \exception InvalidArgument the matching equations could not
         * be created for the given triangulation in the given coordinate
         * system, due to an error that should have been preventable
