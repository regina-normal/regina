/**
 * A collection of angle structures on a 3-manifold triangulation.
 *
 * There are some important changes to this class as of Regina 7.0:
 *
 * - An angle structure list does \e not need to be a child packet of the
 *   underlying triangulation, and indeed does not need to interact with
 *   the packet tree at all.
 *
 * - You are welcome to modify or even destroy the original triangulation;
 *   if you do then this list will automatically make a private copy of the
 *   original triangulation as an ongoing reference.  Different angle
 *   structure lists (and normal surface lists) can all share the same
 *   private copy, so this is not an expensive process.
 *
 * - You should now create angle structure lists using the class constructor
 *   (but which, unlike the old enumerate(), does not insert the list
 *   into the packet tree).  There is no need to use enumerate() any more.
 *
 * Since Regina 7.0, this is no longer a "packet type" that can be
 * inserted directly into the packet tree.  Instead an angle structure list
 * is now a standalone mathematatical object, which makes it slimmer and
 * faster for ad-hoc use.  The consequences of this are:
 *
 * - If you create your own AngleStructures object, it will not have any of
 *   the usual packet infrastructure.  You cannot add it into the packet tree,
 *   and it will not support a label, tags, child/parent packets, and/or
 *   event listeners.
 *
 * - To include an AngleStructures object in the packet tree, you must create
 *   a new PacketOf<AngleStructures>.  This \e is a packet type, and supports
 *   labels, tags, child/parent packets, and event listeners.  It derives from
 *   AngleStructures, and so inherits the full AngleStructures interface.
 *
 * - If you are adding new functions to this class that edit the list,
 *   you must still remember to create a ChangeEventSpan.  This will
 *   ensure that, if the list is being managed by a PacketOf<AngleStructures>,
 *   then the appropriate packet change events will be fired.
 *   All other events (aside from packetToBeChanged() and packetWasChanged()
 *   are managed directly by the PacketOf<AngleStructures> wrapper class.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.

         * If \a tautOnly is \c false (the default), then this new list will

         * these are usually much faster to enumerate.
         *
         * The AngleAlg argument is a combination of flags that allows
         * you to control the underlying enumeration algorithm.  These
         * flags are treated as hints only: if your selection of
         * algorithm is invalid, unavailable or unsupported then Regina

         *
         * Unlike the old enumerate() function, the new angle structure
         * list will \e not be inserted into the packet tree.  Moreover,

         * typically this means that the given tracker must not have been
         * used before.
         *
         * This constructor will not return until the enumeration of angle
         * structures is complete, regardless of whether a progress tracker was
         * passed.  If you need the behaviour of the old enumerate() (where
         * passing a progress tracker caused the enumeration to start in the
         * background), simply call this constructor in a new detached thread.
         * Note that this enumeration can be extremely slow for larger
         * triangulations, and so there could be good reasons to do this.
         *
