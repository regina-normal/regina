/**

 * between Regina's different graphical user interfaces.
 *
 * The syntax highlighting headers are private in the following sense: they are
 * not installed along with Regina's other headers, they do not appear in the
 * API documentation, and the syntax highlighting API is subject to change
 * without notice between different versions of Regina.
