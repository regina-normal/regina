 * @brief Syntax highlighting repository.
 *
 * @section repo_intro Introduction
 *
 * The Repository gives access to all syntax Definitions available on the
 * system, typically described in *.xml files. The Definition files are read
 * from the resource that is compiled into the executable, and from the file
 * system. If a Definition exists in the resource and on the file system,
 * then the one from the file system is chosen.
 *
 * @section repo_access Definitions and Themes
 *
 * Typically, only one instance of the Repository is needed. This single
 * instance can be thought of as a singleton you keep alive throughout the
 * lifetime of your application. Then, call definitionForName() with the
 * given language name (e.g. "Python" or "Java").
 *
 * In addition to Definitions, the Repository also provides a list of Themes.
 * A Theme is defined by a set of default text style colors as well as editor
 * colors. These colors together provide all required colros for drawing all
 * primitives of a text editor. All available Theme%s can be queried through
 * themes(), and a Theme with a specific name is obtained through theme().
 * Additionally, defaultTheme() provides a way to obtain a default theme for
 * either a light or a black color theme.
