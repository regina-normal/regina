/**
 * Color theme definition used for highlighting.
 *
 * @section theme_intro Introduction
 *
 * The Theme provides a full color theme for painting the highlighted text.
 * One Theme is defined as a *.theme file on disk. Each
 * Theme has a unique name().
 * Themes shipped by default are typically read-only, see isReadOnly().
 *
 * A Theme defines two sets of colors:
 * - Text colors, including foreground and background colors, colors for
 *   selected text, and properties such as bold and italic. These colors are
 *   used e.g. by the SyntaxHighlighter.
 * - Editor colors, including a background color for the entire editor widget,
 *   the line number color, etc.
 *
 * @section theme_text_colors Text Colors and the Class Format
 *
 * The text colors are used for syntax highlighting.
 * // TODO: elaborate more and explain relation to Format class
 *
 * @section theme_editor_colors Editor Colors
 *
 * If you want to use the SyntaxHighlighting framework to write your own text
 * editor, you also need to paint the background of the editing widget. In
 * addition, the editor may support showing line numbers, a
 * highlight for the current text line, and similar features. All these colors
 * are defined in terms of the "editor colors" and accessible by calling
 * editorColor() with the desired enum EditorColorRole.
 *
 * @section theme_access Accessing a Theme
 *
 * All available Theme%s are accessed through the Repository. These themes are
 * typically valid themes. If you create a Theme on your own, isValid() will
 * return @e false, and all colors provided by this Theme are in fact invalid
 * and therefore unusable.
 *
 * @see Format
