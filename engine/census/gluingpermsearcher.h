/**
 * A utility class used to build a census of triangulations, by searching
 * through all possible sets of gluing permutations to match a given
 * facet pairing.
 *
 * Currently this class is only implemented in Regina's
 * \ref stddim "standard dimensions".  In higher dimensions, the class
 * GluingPermSearcher<dim> remains undefined, as a placeholder for
 * if/when Regina implements higher-dimensional census code.
 *
 * Gluing permutation searchers are designed to manage the construction of
 * a large census of triangulations, and so they cannot be copied, moved or
 * swapped.  They can be constructed manually if you need fine-grained control,
 * but often this is not necessary either; instead you can run a "typical"
 * census using the static routine GluingPermSearcher<dim>::findAllPerms().
 *
 * For further information, see the documentation for the specialisations
 * GluingPermSearcher<2>, GluingPermSearcher<3> and GluingPermSearcher<4>.
 *
 * \python Python does not support templates.  Instead this class can
 * be used by appending the dimension as a suffix (e.g., GluingPermSearcher2
 * and GluingPermSearcher3 for dimensions 2 and 3).
 *
 * \ingroup census
