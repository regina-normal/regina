/**
 * Represents a specific set of gluing permutations to complement a
 * particular pairwise matching of simplex facets.  Given a pairwise
 * matching of facets (as described by class FacetPairing<dim>),
 * each facet that is matched with some other facet will have an associated
 * permutation of (\a dim + 1) elements.
 *
 * If a facet is matched with some other facet, the two associated
 * permutations in this set will be inverses.  If a facet is left
 * deliberately unmatched, it will have no associated permutation in this set.
 *
 * Such a set of permutations models part of the structure of a
 * triangulation, in which each simplex facet that is glued to another
 * facet has a corresponding gluing permutation (and the matched facet has
 * the inverse gluing permutation).
 *
 * The main purpose of this class is to provide a way of quickly describing
 * and manipulating the combinatorial structure of a triangulation without the
 * overhead of a full-blown Triangulation<dim> object.  In particular, this
 * class was designed for use in census enumeration, which involves rapid
 * construction and editing of these permutations.  To convert this into a
 * full Triangulation<dim> object, you can call triangulate().
 *
 * Internally, this class stores each permutation as an index into
 * Perm<dim+1>::Sn_1 (that is, an index into the permutation group \a S_dim).
 * Importantly, you can only \e set permutations using these indices,
 * via the non-const permIndex() function - access to the permutations
 * themselves is read-only.  You can use indexToGluing() and gluingToIndex()
 * to convert between indicex and permutations, or you can use the read-only
 * member function perm() which returns the permutation directly.  Note
 * that this correspondence is non-trivial, and depends on the details
 * of the underlying facet pairing.
 *
 * This class also supports a special "not yet chosen" permutation,
 * represented using the permutation index -1.  Attempting to convert this
 * to a real permutation using perm() or indexToGluing() is not allowed, and
 * will result in undefined behaviour.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.
 *
 * \headers Parts of this template class are implemented in a separate header
 * (gluingperms-impl.h), which is not included automatically by
 * this file.  However, typical end users should never need this extra header,
 * since Regina's calculation engine already includes explicit instantiations
 * for all dimensions.
 *
 * \tparam dim the dimension of the underlying triangulation that is
 * being modelled.  This must be between 2 and 15 inclusive.
