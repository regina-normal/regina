/**
 * A utility class for searching through all possible gluing permutation
 * sets that correspond to a given pentachoron facet pairing.  Subclasses of
 * GluingPermSearcher<4> correspond to specialised (and heavily optimised)
 * search algorithms that may be used in sufficiently constrained scenarios.
 * The main class GluingPermSearcher<4> offers a default (but slower) search
 * algorithm that may be used in more general contexts.
 *
 * The simplest way of performing a search through all possible gluing
 * permutations is by calling the static method findAllPerms().  This will
 * examine the search parameters and ensure that the best possible algorithm
 * is used.  For finer control over the program flow, the static method
 * bestSearcher() can be used to create a search manager of the most
 * suitable class and then runSearch() can be called on this object directly.
 * For absolute control, a specific algorithm can be forced by explicitly
 * constructing an object of the corresponding class (and again
 * calling runSearch() on that object directly).
 *
 * The search algorithm used by this base class employs modified
 * union-find structures for both triangle and edge equivalence classes to
 * prune searches that are guaranteed to lead to invalid triangles or edges.
 * This is a 4-dimensional analogue to the algorithms described in
 * "Enumeration of non-orientable 3-manifolds using face-pairing graphs and
 * union-find", Benjamin A. Burton, Discrete Comput. Geom. 38 (2007), no. 3,
 * 527--571.
 *
 * This class is designed to manage the construction of a large census of
 * triangulations, and so it does not support copying, moving or swapping.

                     Note that in most cases (see below) this is not the

                     the edge link, then this array describes the boundary

                     The boundary segment described by \a bdryNext[1] follows
                     on from this segment in the direction described by the

                     (i.e., all three facets of this pentachoron surrounding
                     this edge are boundary facets, or one is a boundary and
                     the other two are joined together), then both elements of
                     \a bdryNext refer to this pentachoron edge itself.  These

                     maintains the last values it had when there was at
                     least one boundary edge earlier in the search.

                     Each element of this array lies between 0 and

                     segments.  The \a bdryNext array defines an orientation

         * pentachora.

         * must be (edgeID / 10).  It is passed separately to avoid a

         * containing the edge of the linking triangle that is
         * under consideration.  This must be between 0 and 4 inclusive.

         * boundary edge of the link; see the PentEdgeState::bdryNext
         * notes for details on which directions correspond to array
         * indices 0 and 1.

         * boundary edges are consistent with the orientation of this
         * boundary edge; see the PentEdgeState::bdryTwist notes for
