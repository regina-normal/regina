/**
 * Specifies whether the ClosedPrimeMinSearcher census generation code
 * should prune on high-degree edges.
 *
 * It is well known that a closed prime minimal P^2-irreducible triangulation
 * formed from at least three tetrahedra can never have an edge of degree
 * one or two.  Combining this with the fact that such a triangulation
 * must always have one vertex, a simple Euler characteristic
 * calculation shows that there must be precisely n+1 edges, where \a n
 * is the number of tetrahedra.
 *
 * A little arithmetic then shows that, for any \a k edges, the sum of
 * their edge degrees can be no more than 3(n+k-1); otherwise one of the
 * remaining edges will be forced to have degree one or two.  This
 * observation is the basis behind the high-degree edge pruning that
 * this option controls.
 *
 * To enable pruning on high-degree edges, set this macro to 1 (the default
 * for Regina's main source distribution); to disable it, set it to 0.

 * A utility class for searching through all possible gluing permutation

 * The main class GluingPermSearcher<3> offers a default (but slower) search

 *
 * The simplest way of performing a search through all possible gluing
 * permutations is by calling the static method findAllPerms().  This will
 * examine the search parameters and ensure that the best possible algorithm
 * is used.  For finer control over the program flow, the static method
 * bestSearcher() can be used to create a search manager of the most
 * suitable class and then runSearch() can be called on this object directly.
 * For absolute control, a specific algorithm can be forced by explicitly
 * constructing an object of the corresponding class (and again
 * calling runSearch() on that object directly).
 *
 * This class is designed to manage the construction of a large census of
 * triangulations, and so it does not support copying, moving or swapping.
