/**
 * A lightweight class for storing a random-access sequence of objects.
 *
 * This class is intended as a lightweight substitute for std::vector,
 * especially when working with temporary sequences that are frequently
 * created and destroyed.  The underlying storage just uses a native
 * C-style array, and the C++ class wrapper provides the usual mechanisms
 * for safe and simple memory management.
 *
 * The size (number of elements) of a sequence can be changed, but this
 * should not be done lightly.  Unlike std::vector, resizing a sequence
 * is an expensive operation that deletes all existing contents of the
 * sequence and forces a reallocation of the underlying storage.
 * See init() for details.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.

         *

         *
         * This class is meant to be lightweight: it merely stores a
         * reference to the list of elements to compare, and it is safe

         *
         * \tparam IndexIterator the iterator type used to store the range
         * of indices that define the subsequences being compared (that is,
         * the range of indices \a i0, \a i1, \a i2, ...).  This would be
