/**
 * A bitmask that can store arbitrarily many true-or-false bits.
 *
 * This bitmask packs the bits together, so that (unlike an array of bools)
 * many bits can be stored in a single byte.  As a result, operations on
 * this class are fast because the CPU can work on many bits simultaneously.
 *
 * Nevertheless, this class still has overhead because the bits must be
 * allocated on the heap, and because every operation requires looping
 * through the individual bytes.  For reasonably small bitmasks, see the
 * highly optimised Bitmask1 and Bitmask2 classes instead.
 *
 * Once a bitmask is created, the only way its length (the number of bits)
 * can be changed is by calling reset(size_t).
 *
 * The length of the bitmask is not actually stored in this structure.
 * This means that, upon construction (or reset), the length will be
 * automatically rounded up to the next "raw unit of storage".
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.
 *
 * \todo \opt Insist that sizeof(Piece) is a power of two, and replace
 * expensive division/mod operations with cheap bit operations.
 *
 * \warning Because this class may increase the length of the bitmask
 * (rounding up to the next unit of storage), bitwise computations may
 * not give the results that you expect.  In particular, flip() may set
 * additional \c true bits in the "dead space" between the intended length
 * and the actual length, and this may have a flow-on effect for other
 * operations (such as subset testing, bit counting and so on).  Be careful!

 * A small but extremely fast bitmask class that can store up to

 *
 * This bitmask packs all of the bits together into a single variable of
 * type \a T and a single variable of type \a U.  This means that operations
 * on entire bitmasks are extremely fast, because all of the bits can be
 * processed in just two "native" operations.
 *
 * The downside of course is that the number of bits that can be stored
 * is limited to 8 * sizeof(\a T) + 8 * sizeof(\a U), where \a T and \a U
 * must be native unsigned integer types (such as unsigned char, unsigned int,
 * or unsigned long long).
 *
 * For an even faster bitmask class that can only store half as many bits,
 * see Bitmask1.  For a bitmask class that can store arbitrarily many bits,
 * see Bitmask.
 *
 * These objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with std::swap(),
 * with no need for any specialised move operations or swap functions.
 *
 * \pre Types \a T and \a U are unsigned integral numeric types.
