/*! \page tight Tight encodings of data
 *
 * Regina includes support for <i>tight encodings</i>, which are
 * encodings of various data types as short printable strings.
 *
 * Tight encodings have the following properties:
 *
 * - They use only printable ASCII characters (the 94 ASCII values from
 *   33 to 126 inclusive), and do not contain any whitespace.  This means
 *   (for example) you can use them as whitespace-separated tokens in plain
 *   text files.  However, they do make use of \e all of the ASCII punctuation
 *   symbols, and so you must take care when (for example) trying to hard-code
 *   them as strings in source code, or using them as components of filenames.
 *
 * - They aim to be short (typically much shorter than the usual human-readable
 *   representations, such as decimal representations of integers or full text
 *   representations of polynomials).
 *
 * - When reading an encoded object character-by-character, the encoding
 *   contains enough information to know when the last character has been read
 *   (even without the foreknowledge of whether the input stream contains more
 *   characters).
 *
 * - Objects with the same inherent value, even if they use different
 *   underlying C++ types, will encode to the same string.  For example,
 *   the integer 7 will have the same encoding regardless of whether it
 *   is stored as an \c int, a \c long, or a regina::Integer.  Note that
 *   this guarantee only extends to types that "conceptually" intend to
 *   represent the same broad types of objects, possibly with different
 *   limitations.  So, for example, there is no guarantee that the integer 7,
 *   the rational 7/1, and/or the constant \e polynomial 7 would encode to
 *   the same string.
 *
 * - Conversely, objects of the same type but with different inherent values
 *   will encode to different strings.  So, for example, the integers 7 and -7
 *   will have different encodings.
 *
 * A consequence of the last two points is that, if the \e type of an object
 * is known in advance, then its \e value can be recovered from its encoding.
 * However, the encoding does not contain enough information to deduce the
 * type if this is not already known.
 *
 * Because encodings contain enough information to identify where they end,
 * this means that you can encode a \e sequence of objects by concatenating
 * the individual encodings with no separators, and (assuming the types
 * of the objects are fixed) this will be enough to guarantee that
 * different \e sequences likewise have different encodngs.
 *
 * Tight encodings were originally designed to support perfect hashing
 * (essentially "compressing" data into a short printable string whilst
 * preserving the correctness of equality tests).  As a result, they were
 * originally intended to be used only in one direction.  However, Regina
 * does provide matching \e decoding routines if you need to reconstruct
 * objects from their tight encodings.
 *
 * For native C++ data types where tight encodings and decodings are supported,
 * these are provided in the header utilities/tightencoding.h through overloads
 * of the global functions tightEncoding() and tightDecoding() (which work
 * with strings), and tightEncode() and tightDecode() (which work with
 * input/output streams).
 *
 * For Regina's own data types where tight encodings and decodings are
 * supported, these are provided through member functions tightEncoding(),
 * tightEncode(), tightDecoding() and tightDecode() within the corresponding
 * classes.
 */

/**
 * A base class that assists with support for tight encodings and
 * corresponding decodings.
 *
 * If a class \a T supports tight encodings, then it \e may derive from
 * TightEncodable<T>.  If it does, then your derived class must provide
 * the following two functions, which implement tight encodings and decodings
 * via input/output streams:
 *
 * - <tt>void tightEncode(std::ostream&) const</tt>, which writes a tight
 *   encoding of the object to the given output stream.  This is allowed
 *   to (but not required to) throw a FailedPrecondition if the object
 *   is in an invalid state; if so then the exception should be documented
 *   in this member function T::tightEncode().
 *
 * - <tt>static T tightDecode(std::istream&)</tt>, which reconstructs an
 *   object of type \a T from a tight encoding that is read from the given
 *   input stream.  This routine must not skip leading whitespace, and must
 *   leave the input stream positioned immediately after the encoding
 *   (without consuming any trailing whitespace or other characters).
 *   This should throw an InvalidInput exception if the input stream
 *   does not begin with a valid tight encoding of an object of type \a T.
 *
 * In return, this base class will provide the following two functions,
 * both of which work with strings (and which are documented in full below):
 *
 * - <tt>std::string tightEncoding() const</tt>; and
 *
 * - <tt>static T tightDecoding(const std::string&)</tt>.
 *
 * A class \a T that supports tight encodings does not \e need to derive from
 * TightEncodable.  However, if it does not then it should implement all four
 * of the above functions itself.  Examples of this include the permutation
 * classes (which have optimised implementations due to their very small space
 * requirements), and the arbitrary-precision integer classes (which use the
 * global integer encoding/decoding routines).
 *
 * \tparam T the type of object being encoded/decoded; this must derive
 * from TightEncodable<T>.
 *
 * \note Every object of this class that is ever instantiated \e must be
 * derived from the class \a T.  In other words, end users cannot
 * construct objects of the parent class TightEncodable<T>.
 *
 * \ifacespython Not present, but the routines tightEncoding() and
 * tightDecoding() will be provided directly through the various subclasses.

     * Internal function that reconstructs an integer that was encoded
     * using tightEncodeIndex().  This encoding method is used for integers
     * that are either non-negative or -1, and is not compatible with
     * Regina's general integer encodings.
     *
     * The tight encoding will be read from the given input stream.  If the
     * input stream contains leading whitespace then it will be treated as an
     * invalid encoding (i.e., this routine will throw an exception).  The
     * input routine \e may contain further data: if this routine is successful
     * then the input stream will be left positioned immediately after the
     * encoding, without skipping any trailing whitespace.
     *
     * \exception InvalidInput the given input stream does not begin with a
     * tight encoding of an integer of type \a Int using the encoding scheme
     * defined by tightEncodeIndex().  This includes the case where the
     * encoding \e is a valid non-negative integer encoding but the integer
     * itself is outside the allowed range for the \a Int type.
     *
     * \ifacespython Not present.
     *
     * \tparam Int The type of integer to reconstruct.  Currently this must be
     * either \c ssize_t (the only allowed signed type), or one of the
     * unsigned native C++ integer types that holds at least 16 bits.
     * This list of types may be expanded in future versions of Regina.
     *
     * @param input an input stream that begins with a tight encoding.
     * @return the integer represented by the given tight encoding.
