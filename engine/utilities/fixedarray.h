/**
 * A lightweight fixed-size random-access array whose size can be provided at
 * runtime.  After construction, the size of the array cannot be changed.
 *
 * This class is intended to be used for temporary working arrays within the
 * implementations of algorithms: it is lightweight and provides the speed of
 * C-style arrays, but avoids the pitfalls of `new[]` and `delete[]`, instead
 * offering safe and simple stack-based memory mangement and exception safety.
 *
 * This class is very similar in nature to LightweightSequence, but was born
 * from different needs.  It is possible that these two classes will be unified
 * in some future version of Regina.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.
