 * Returns time and memory usage for the current process, for use on Linux
 * systems.  Information is gathered from the `/proc` filesystem; if
 * this is run on a non-Linux system (or a Linux system where `/proc`
 * is not mounted), then this routine will throw an exception.
 *
 * More precisely, this routine reads information on the running process from
 * `/proc/self/stat`, and returns a tuple (\a utime, \a stime, \a vsize).
 * These three fields reperesent:
 *
 * - the number jiffies that this process has been scheduled in user mode
 *   (the \e utime field);
 * - the number jiffies that this process has been scheduled in kernel mode
 *   (the \e stime field);
 * - the the virtual memory size in bytes (the \e vsize field).
 *
 * The description of these three fields is taken directly from the
 * \c proc(5) manpage.  Note that the length of a jiffy can differ
 * from system to system; see the \c time(7) manpage for details.
 *
 * \exception FileError Either <tt>/proc/self/stat</tt> cannot be read,
 * or it contains unexpected information.
 *
 * \warning Currently this routine allows at most 255 characters for the
 * \e comm field in `/proc/self/stat` (which stores the executable
 * filename along with surrounding parentheses).  If the \e comm field is too
 * long (i.e., the executable filename is too long), then this routine will
 * not be able to parse `/proc/self/stat`, and will throw an exception.
 * If you encounter this problem, you should be able to fix it by renaming
 * your executable to something shorter.

 * on what this information means and on what systems it can be accessed.
