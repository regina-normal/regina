/**
 * A short stack-based array of bounded size.
 *
 * ShortArray represents a stack-based array whose size is bounded above by
 * the compile-time constant \a maxSize, but whose size at runtime can vary
 * between 0 and \a maxSize inclusive.
 *
 * Here "stack-based" means that the array does not use dynamic memory
 * allocation; instead it reserves space for \a maxSize elements directly
 * on the stack.  In this sense, it is analogous to std::array<T, maxSize>
 * or indeed a plain C-style array T[maxSize].  Like these other types,
 * it is fast to access with very little space or time overhead, but it
 * cannot be moved or swapped in constant time.
 *
 * Where ShortArray differs from these other types is that its size can
 * vary at runtime.  Its default constructor initialises it to size zero, and
 * it supports push_back() and pop_back() operations and a size() query which
 * are all very fast.  The size is, however, limited to \a maxSize, and
 * any attempt to push additional elements beyond this limit will result
 * in undefined behaviour.
 *
 * This class was designed with very small arrays in mind; an example is
 * the list of embeddings for a (<i>dim</i>-1)-dimensional face in a
 * <i>dim</i>-dimensional triangulationw, which always has size 1 or 2.
 *
 * This class does not implement move constructors or move assignment,
 * since this cannot be done any faster than a linear-time copy operation.
 * For the same reason, it does not implement its own custom swap functions.
