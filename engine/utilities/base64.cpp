NOTES:          This source code may be used as you wish, subject to

DESCRIPTION:
                This little utility implements the Base64
                Content-Transfer-Encoding standard described in
                RFC1113 (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1113.html).

                This is the coding scheme used by MIME to allow
                binary data to be transferred by SMTP mail.

                Groups of 3 bytes from a binary stream are coded as
                groups of 4 bytes in a text stream.

                The input stream is 'padded' with zeros to create
                an input that is an even multiple of 3.

                A special character ('=') is used to denote padding so
                that the stream can be decoded back to its exact size.

                Encoded output is formatted in lines which should
                be a maximum of 72 characters to conform to the
                specification.  This program defaults to 72 characters,
                but will allow more or less through the use of a
                switch.  The program enforces a minimum line size
                of 4 characters.

                Example encoding:

                The stream 'ABCD' is 32 bits long.  It is mapped as
                follows:

                ABCD

                 A (65)     B (66)     C (67)     D (68)   (None) (None)
                01000001   01000010   01000011   01000100

                16 (Q)  20 (U)  9 (J)   3 (D)    17 (R) 0 (A)  NA (=) NA (=)
                010000  010100  001001  000011   010001 000000 000000 000000


                QUJDRA==

                Decoding is the process in reverse.  A 'decode' lookup
                table has been created to avoid string scans.

DESIGN GOALS:   Specifically:
                Code is a stand-alone utility to perform base64 
                encoding/decoding. It should be genuinely useful 
                when the need arises and it meets a need that is 
                likely to occur for some users.  
                Code acts as sample code to show the author's 
                design and coding style.  

                Generally: 
                This program is designed to survive:
                Everything you need is in a single source file.
                It compiles cleanly using a vanilla ANSI C compiler.
                It does its job correctly with a minimum of fuss.  
                The code is not overly clever, not overly simplistic 
                and not overly verbose. 
                Access is 'cut and paste' from a web page.  
                Terms of use are reasonable.  

VALIDATION:     Non-trivial code is never without errors.  This
                file likely has some problems, since it has only
                been tested by the author.  It is expected with most
                source code that there is a period of 'burn-in' when
                problems are identified and corrected.  That being
                said, it is possible to have 'reasonably correct'
                code by following a regime of unit test that covers
                the most likely cases and regression testing prior
                to release.  This has been done with this code and
                it has a good probability of performing as expected.

                Unit Test Cases:

                case 0:empty file:
                    CASE0.DAT  ->  ->
                    (Zero length target file created
                    on both encode and decode.)

                case 1:One input character:
                    CASE1.DAT A -> QQ== -> A

                case 2:Two input characters:
                    CASE2.DAT AB -> QUI= -> AB

                case 3:Three input characters:
                    CASE3.DAT ABC -> QUJD -> ABC

                case 4:Four input characters:
                    case4.dat ABCD -> QUJDRA== -> ABCD

                case 5:All chars from 0 to ff, linesize set to 50:

                case 7: Large files:

                case 8: Random Binary Integrity:
                    This binary program (b64.exe) was encoded to base64,
                    back to binary and then executed.

                case 9 Stress:
                    All files in a working directory encoded/decoded
                    and compared with file comparison utility to
                    ensure that multiple runs do not cause problems
                    such as exhausting file handles, tmp storage, etc.
