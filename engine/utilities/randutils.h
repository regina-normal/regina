/**
 * Offers threadsafe access to Regina's global uniform random bit generator.
 *
 * Regina has at its heart a global uniform random bit generator (URBG) that
 * complies with the C++ UniformRandomBitGenerator concept, and can be used
 * with other data types and algorithms from the standard \c random header.
 *
 * An object of this class offers threadsafe access to this global URBG.
 *
 * This class behaves in many ways like std::scoped_lock.  On construction a
 * RandomEngine object will lock an internal mutex that grants exclusive
 * access to the global URBG, and on destruction the RandomEngine object will
 * unlock this mutex.
 *
 * The engine() function grants direct access to the URBG.  To ensure
 * thread safety, you should only use this URBG during the scope of the
 * RandomEngine object (i.e., while the internal mutex is locked).
 * The easiest way to do this is to never store a reference to engine() for
 * later use, but instead to pass engine() directly to other random number
 * generation functions as you use them.
 *
 * The engine is seeded with a default value.  This means that each time
 * you run the same code in a new process (but on the same machine), you
 * should receive the same sequence of random bits.  However, the generation
 * algorithm may be specific to your machine, so running the same code on
 * different machines might well \e not generate the same random bits.
 *
 * If you need to re-seed the random engine with a value that is
 * unpredictable (e.g., using hardware entropy), you can call
 * reseedWithHardware().  If you wish to re-seed the random engine with
 * its default value (to behave as though the process had just started),
 * you can call reseedWithDefault().
 *
 * RandomEngine objects are not copyable, movable or swappable.  In particular,
 * Regina does not offer any way for a RandomEngine to transfer its duty
 * (i.e., unlocking the internal mutex upon destruction) to another object.
 *
 * \warning Locks are \e not recursive.  If the same thread attempts to
 * create a second RandomEngine object before the previous one is destroyed,
 * the resulting behaviour is undefined.
 *
 * \ifacespython Python users only have access to the static member
 * functions in this class (which still supports basic random number
 * generation as well as reseeding).
