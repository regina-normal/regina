/**
 * A common base class for objects that write human-readable text output.
 * This class ensures that text output routines have consistent
 * names and behaviours across Regina's entire API.
 *
 * Three types of output are supported:
 *
 * - \e short output, which fits on a single line and uses plain ASCII
 *   characters wherever possible;
 * - \e utf8 output, which is like short output but supports the much richer
 *   unicode character set; and
 * - \e detailed output, which may be arbitrarily long.
 *
 * Any class that provides text output should ultimately inherit from
 * this base class.  Your derived class must provide two functions:
 *
 * - <tt>writeTextShort(std::ostream& out, bool utf8 = false)</tt>, which writes
 *   either the short output or the utf8 output to the given output stream,
 *   according to whether \a utf8 is \c false or \c true respectively;
 *
 * - <tt>writeTextLong(std::ostream& out)</tt>, which writes the detailed
 *   output to the given output stream.
 *
 * The boolean \a utf8 argument to writeTextShort() must be optional.
 * Moreover, if your class does not benefit from unicode characters (i.e.,
 * the short and utf8 outputs are identical), then you may omit the \a utf8
 * argument entirely; in this case, you must set the template argument
 * \a supportsUtf8 as \c false.  Both \a writeTextShort() and
 * \a writeTextLong() may take additional arguments, as long as they are
 * optional.
 *
 * The documentation for str(), utf8() and detail() gives guidelines as to how
 * the various types of output should be formatted.
 *
 * In return, this class will provide the functions str(), utf8() and detail(),
 * which return the short, utf8 and detailed outputs respectively in
 * std::string format.  It will also provide a global operator << that
 * allows you to write objects of type \a T to an arbitrary output stream.
 *
 * If your class is simple and has no need for detailed output then it may
 * derive from ShortOutput instead, which provides a default
 * implementation for \a writeTextLong().
 *
 * \tparam T the class that provides the implementations of
 * \a writeTextShort() and \a writeTextLong().  Typically this will be
 * your own class (i.e., your class \a C derives from Output<C>).
 * However, this may be deeper in the class hierarchy.
 *
 * \tparam supportsUtf8 \c true if the class \a T can make use of the
 * richer unicode character set, or \c false if the short and utf8 outputs
 * are identical.  If this is \c false then T::writeTextShort() will only
 * ever be called in the form <tt>writeTextShort(std::ostream&)</tt>,
 * and you may for simplicity omit the second boolean \a utf8 argument.
 * This Output base class will still provide a utf8() function, but it will
 * return the same output as short().
 *
 * \note Every object of this class that is ever instantiated \e must be
 * derived from the class \a T.  In other words, end users can construct
 * objects of type \a T (which derives from Output<T>), but they cannot
 * construct objects of the parent class Output<T> itself.
 *
 * \ifacespython Not present, but the output routines str(), utf8() and
 * detail() will be provided directly through the various subclasses.
