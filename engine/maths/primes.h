/**
 * A helper class for finding primes and factorising integers.
 *
 * This class has two functions: (i) to maintain a list of known primes,
 * and (ii) to use this list to factorise integers into prime factors.
 *
 * The primes stored by this class will always be the smallest \a k
 * suspected primes, where \a k may grow dynamically as the program runs.
 * Specifically:
 *
 * - An initial hard-coded list of seed primes is loaded into the class on
 *   startup.  This list contains precisely the smallest 10,000 primes (the
 *   size of this list is subject to change in future versions of Regina).
 *
 * - Whenever a prime beyond the known list is requested (e.g., when a
 *   number greater than the largest stored prime is to be factorised), the
 *   list is extended on the fly.  The extension uses the probabilistic
 *   algorithm shipped with GMP (hence the phrase "suspected primes" above);
 *   regarding this algorithm, the GMP documentation states that "for
 *   practical purposes it's adequate, the chance of a composite passing
 *   will be extremely small."
 *
 * This list is used by the high-level factorisation routines in this
 * class, such as primeDecomp() and primePowerDecomp().  For users only
 * interested in these high-level routines, there is no need to worry
 * about the size of the list; the high-level routines will extend it if
 * necessary.
 *
 * Although this class makes use of global data in its implementation, all
 * of its methods are thread-safe.
