/**
 * Represents an arbitrary precision rational number.
 * Calculations with Rational objects will be exact.
 *
 * Infinity (1/0) and undefined (0/0) are catered for.  (-1/0) is considered
 * the same as (1/0), and is represented as (1/0).
 * Any operation involving (0/0) will return (0/0).
 *
 * Since infinity is the same as negative infinity, both infinity plus
 * infinity and infinity minus infinity will return infinity.  Infinity
 * divided by infinity returns undefined, as does infinity times zero.
 *
 * For the purposes of ordering, undefined is the smallest rational and
 * infinity is the largest.  Undefined is always equal to itself, and
 * infinity is always equal to itself.
 *
 * When performing computations on rationals, the results will always be
 * stored in lowest terms (i.e., with relatively prime numerator and
 * denominator), and with a non-negative denominator.
 * However, when constructing a rational number from scratch (e.g., by
 * supplying the numerator and denominator separately), it is your
 * responsibility to ensure that the rational is in lowest terms.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.
