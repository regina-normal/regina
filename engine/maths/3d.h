 * Represents a rotation about the origin in real three-dimensional space.
 *
 * Regina stores a rotation using a _quaternion_, which consists of four real
 * numbers.  We refer to these four numbers as the _quaternion coordinates_.
 *
 * Specifically, suppose we rotate by an angle of θ around the axis pointing
 * from the origin to the unit vector `(x,y,z)`, and this rotation follows a
 * right-hand rule (the thumb of the right hand points from the origin out
 * towards `(x,y,z)`, and the fingers follow the direction of the rotation).
 * Then the four real numbers that make up the quaternion are
 * `(cos θ/2, x sin θ/2, y sin θ/2, z sin θ/2)`.  Since the axis vector
 *
 * Regarding normalisation:
 *
 * - In theory, a quaternion that describes a rotation must be _normalised_;
 *   that is, its four real quaternion coordinates must form a unit vector in
 *   4-D.  This follows immediately from the discussion above, using the fact
 *   that the axis vector `(x,y,z)` is a unit vector in 3-D.
 *
 * - In this class, however, we do _not_ require the quaternion coordinates to
 *   be normalised, since this may allow quaternions to be constructed more
 *   easily.  Instead we allow the quaternion coordinates `(λa, λb, λc, λd)`
 *   to represent the same rotation as `(a,b,c,d)` for any positive λ (and,
 *   if we ignore the _direction_ of rotation and just consider its endpoint,
 *   then for any negative λ also).
 *
 * - If you wish (though this is not actually necessary), you can normalise
 *   the coordinates yourself by calling normalise().
 *
 * See Regina's \ref 3d "notes on 3-D geometry" for importing information,
 * including the inexact floating-point nature of the Vector3D class, and the
 * right-handedness of Regina's coordinate system.
 *
 * These objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with std::swap(),
 * with no need for any specialised move operations or swap functions.
