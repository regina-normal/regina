 * Transforms a given matrix into column echelon form with respect to a

 *
 * Given the matrix \a M and the list \a rowList of rows from \a M, this
 * algorithm puts \a M in column echelon form with respect to the rows
 * in \a rowList.  The only purpose of \a rowList is to clarify and/or
 * weaken precisely what is meant by "column echelon form"; all rows of
 * \a M are affected by the resulting column operations that take place.
 *
 * This routine also returns the corresponding change of coordinate
 * matrices \a R and \a Ri:
 *
 * - If \a R and \a Ri are passed as identity matrices, the returned
 *   matrices will be such that <tt>original_M * R = final_M</tt> and
 *   <tt>final_M * Ri = original_M</tt> (and of course <tt>final_M</tt> is
 *   in column echelon form with respect to the given row list).
 * - If \a R and \a Ri are already non-trivial coordinate transformations,
 *   they are modified appropriately by the algorithm.
 *
 * Our convention is that a matrix is in column echelon form if:
 *
 * -# each column is either zero or there is a first non-zero entry which
 *    is positive (but see the note regarding \a rowList below);
 * -# moving from the leftmost column to the rightmost column, the rows
 *    containing the first non-zero entries for these columns have strictly
 *    increasing indices in \a rowList;
 * -# given a first non-zero column entry, in that row all the elements to
 *    the left are smaller and non-negative (all elements to the right are
 *    already zero by the previous condition);
 * -# all the zero columns are on the right hand side of the matrix.
 *
 * By a "zero column" here we simply mean "zero for every row in \a
 * rowList".  Likewise, by "first non-zero entry" we mean "first row in
 * \a rowList with a non-zero entry".
 *
 * In a pinch, you can also use this routine to compute the inverse of an
 * invertible square matrix.
 *
 * If you just wish to reduce the matrix, you do not care about the order of
 * rows, and you do not want the change-of-basis matrices, then you should
 * call MatrixInt::columnEchelonForm() instead, which is simpler but also more
 * streamlined.

 * and these matrices are inverses of each other.
 *
 * @param M the matrix to reduce.
 * @param R used to return the row-reduction matrix, as described above.
 * @param Ri used to return the inverse of \a R.
 * @param rowList the rows to pay attention to.  This list must contain
 * distinct integers, all between 0 and M.rows()-1 inclusive.  The
 * integers may appear in any order (though changing the order will
 * change the resulting column echelon form).  For a "classical" column
