/**
 * An optimised vector class of elements from a given ring T.
 * Various mathematical vector operations are available.
 *
 * This class is intended for serious computation, and as a result it has a
 * streamlined implementation with no virtual methods.  It can be subclassed,
 * but since there are no virtual methods, type information must generally
 * be known at compile time.  Nevertheless, in many respects, different
 * subclasses of Vector<T> can happily interact with one another.
 *
 * This class is written with bulky types in mind (such as arbitrary precision
 * integers), and so creations and operations are kept to a minimum.
 *
 * As of Regina 7.0, this class explicitly supports zero-length vectors.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.
 *
 * \warning As of Regina 4.90, this class merges the old functionality of
 * NFastVector and the NVector hierarchy from Regina 4.6.  As a side-effect,
 * the hierarchy has been compressed into just one class (NVectorUnit,
 * NVectorMatrix and NVectorDense are gone), elements are always stored as
 * dense vectors, and functions are no longer virtual (since the storage
 * model is now fixed).  The virtual clone() method is gone completely
 * (since there are no longer virtual functions you should use the copy
 * constructor instead), and the old makeLinComb() method is also gone
 * (just use operator *= and addCopies()).
 * 
 * \pre Type T has a copy constructor.  That is,
 * if \c a and \c b are of type T, then \c a can be initialised to the value
 * of \c b using `a(b)`.
 * \pre Type T has a default constructor.  That is,
 * an object of type T can be declared with no arguments.  No specific
 * default value is required.
 * \pre Type T allows for operators `=`, `==`, `+=`,
 * `-=`, `*=`, `+`, `-` and `*`.
 * \pre Type T has an integer constructor.  That is, if \c a is of type T,
 * then \c a can be initialised to an integer \c l using `a(l)`.
 * \pre An element \c t of type T can be written to an output stream
 * \c out using the standard expression `out << t`.
 *
 * \python Only the specific types Vector<Integer> and
 * Vector<LargeInteger> are available, under the names VectorInt and
 * VectorLarge respectively.
