/**
 * Represents a permutation of {0,1,2,3}.
 * This is a specialisation of the generic Perm template: it is highly
 * optimised, and also offers some additional functionality.
 * Amongst other things, this permutation class is used to specify how
 * simplices of a 3-manifold triangulation are glued together.
 *
 * As with all Perm template classes, these objects are small enough to pass
 * by value and swap with std::swap(), with no need for any specialised move
 * operations or swap functions.  Moreover, Perm<4> in particular is extremely
 * fast to work with.
 *
 * Each permutation has an internal code, which is a single native
 * integer that is sufficient to reconstruct the permutation.
 * Thus the internal code may be a useful means for passing permutation
 * objects to and from the engine.  For Perm<4>, the internal permutation
 * codes have changed as of Regina 4.6.1:
 *
 * - _First-generation_ codes were used internally in Regina 4.6 and earlier.
 *   These are _image packs_: characters whose lowest two bits represent
 *   the image of 0, whose next lowest two bits represent the image of 1,
 *   and so on.  The routines permCode1(), setPermCode1(), fromPermCode1()
 *   and isPermCode1() continue to work with first-generation codes for
 *   backward compatibility.  Likewise, the XML data file format
 *   continues to use first-generation codes to describe tetrahedron gluings.
 *
 * - _Second-generation_ codes are used internally in Regina 4.6.1 and above.
 *   These codes are integers between 0 and 23 inclusive, representing the
 *   index of the permutation in the array Perm<4>::S4.  The routines
 *   permCode2(), setPermCode2(), fromPermCode2() and isPermCode2()
 *   work with second-generation codes.
 *
 * It is highly recommended that, if you need to work with permutation
 * codes at all, you use second-generation codes where possible.  This
 * is because the first-generation routines incur additional overhead
 * in converting back and forth between the second-generation codes
 * (which are used internally by Perm<4>).
 *
 * To use this class, simply include the main permutation header maths/perm.h.
 *
 * \python Since Python does not support templates, this class is
 * made available under the name Perm4.
 *
