/**
 * Represents a permutation of {0,1,2}.
 * This is a specialisation of the generic Perm template: it is highly
 * optimised, and also offers some additional functionality.
 * Amongst other things, this permutation class is used to specify how
 * simplices of a 2-manifold triangulation are glued together.
 *
 * As with all Perm template classes, these objects are small enough to pass
 * by value and swap with std::swap(), with no need for any specialised move
 * operations or swap functions.  Moreover, Perm<3> in particular is extremely
 * fast to work with.
 *
 * Each permutation has an internal code, which is a single native
 * integer that is sufficient to reconstruct the permutation.
 * Thus the internal code may be a useful means for passing permutation
 * objects to and from the engine.  For Perm<3>, the internal code is an
 * integer between 0 and 5 inclusive that gives the index of the
 * permutation in the array Perm<3>::S3.  This is consistent with the
 * second-generation codes used in classes Perm<4>,...,Perm<7>.
 *
 * To use this class, simply include the main permutation header maths/perm.h.
 *
 * \python Since Python does not support templates, this class is
 * made available under the name Perm3.
