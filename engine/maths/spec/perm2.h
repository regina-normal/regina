/**
 * Represents a permutation of {0,1}.
 * This is a specialisation of the generic Perm template: it is highly
 * optimised, but also somewhat trivial (since there are only two
 * possible permutations).  It is provided simply to optimise the general
 * Perm<n> template for this trivial case.
 *
 * As with all Perm template classes, these objects are small enough to pass
 * by value and swap with std::swap(), with no need for any specialised move
 * operations or swap functions.  Moreover, Perm<2> in particular is extremely
 * fast to work with.
 *
 * Each permutation has an internal code, which is a single native
 * integer that is sufficient to reconstruct the permutation.
 * Thus the internal code may be a useful means for passing permutation
 * objects to and from the engine.  For Perm<2>, the internal code is 0 for
 * the identity permutation, or 1 for the (unique) non-identity permutation.
 * This is consistent with the second-generation codes used in classes
 * Perm<4>,...,Perm<7>.
 *
 * To use this class, simply include the main permutation header maths/perm.h.
 *
 * \warning Every permutation class Perm<n> provides a transposition
 * (i.e., pair swap) constructor `Perm<n>(a,b).`  In addition, the
 * specialised classes Perm<3>, Perm<4> and Perm<5> provide "list of images"
 * constructors `Perm<3>(a,b,c)`, `Perm<4>(a,b,c,d)` and
 * `Perm<5>(a,b,c,d,e)`.  For Perm<2>, these two constructors would
 * be indistinguishable (since both would take two integer arguments).
 * Here Perm<2> takes an approach that is consistent with the generic Perm<n>
 * class: `Perm<2>(a,b)` is interpreted as the _transposition_ of
 * \a a and \a b.  In particular, `Perm(0,1)` is _not_ the
 * identity permutation.
 *
 * \python Since Python does not support templates, this class is
 * made available under the name Perm2.
