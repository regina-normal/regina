/**
 * Represents a group of permutations on \a n elements.  This is a subgroup
 * of the symmetric group `S_n`.
 *
 * Groups are stored internally using Sims tables (see Knuth volume 4A for a
 * description of how these work); these are called _stabiliser chains_ in
 * many places.  This storage mechanism means that, even though a permutation
 * group could have size factorial in \a n, the storage space required is only
 * quadratic in \a n.
 *
 * PermGroup objects are, in their current implementation, entirely
 * stack-based.  This means they cannot support fast move or swap operations.
 * However, since their size is quadratic in \a n, copy operations involve
 * significantly more overhead than (for example) just copying a Perm object
 * (which just holds a single machine-native integer).  This decision is a
 * deliberate trade-off between speed versus space; the implication for
 * end users is that you should be economical about copying PermGroup objects,
 * and work with them in-place where possible.
 *
 * \python Python does not support templates.  In Python, the "vanilla"
 * non-cached variants `Perm<n>` are available under the names
 * PermGroup2, PermGroup3, ..., PermGroup16, and the cached variants
 * `Perm<n, true>` are available under the names
 * PermGroup2_Cached, PermGroup3_Cached, ..., PermGroup16_Cached.
 *
 * \tparam n the number of objects being permuted.
 * This must be between 2 and 16 inclusive.
 * \tparam cached \c true if we should use precomputation-assisted routines
 * such as Perm<n>::cachedComp() and Perm<n>::cachedInverse(), or \c false
 * (the default) if we should just use the composition operator, inverse(),
 * and so on.  If this argument is \c true, you _must_ have called
 * Perm<n>::precompute() at least once in the lifetime of the program
 * before using this class.
