/**
 * Represents a matrix of elements of the given type \a T.
 *
 * As of Regina 5.96, the old subclasses of Matrix have now been merged into a
 * single Matrix class.  The additional member functions that the old
 * subclasses MatrixRing and MatrixIntDomain used to provide are now part of
 * Matrix, and are enabled or disabled according to the Matrix template
 * parameters.
 *
 * It is generally safe to just use the type Matrix<T>, since the \c ring
 * argument has a sensible default.  At present, \c ring defaults to \c true
 * (thereby enabling member functions designed for matrices over rings)
 * when \a T is one of the following types:
 *
 * - native C++ integer types (i.e., where std::is_integral<T>::value
 *   is \c true and \a T is not bool); or
 *
 * - Regina's own types Integer, LargeInteger, NativeInteger<...>, and Rational.
 *
 * Other types may be added to this list in future versions of Regina.
 *
 * There are several requirements for the underlying type \a T.
 * For all matrix types:
 *
 * - \a T must have a default constructor and an assignment operator.
 *
 * - An element <i>t</i> of type \a T must be writable to an output stream
 *   using the standard stream operator <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>.
 *
 * If \a ring is \c true, then in addition to this:
 *
 * - \a T must support binary operators <tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt> and <tt>*</tt>,
 *   and unary operators <tt>+=</tt>, <tt>-=</tt> and <tt>*=</tt>.
 *
 * - \a T must be able to be constructed or assigned to from the integers
 *   0 and 1 (representing the additive and multiplicative identities in the
 *   ring respectively).  Likewise, \a T must be able to be tested for
 *   equality or inequality against 0 or 1 also.
 *
 * In particular, all of Regina's integer and rational types (Integer,
 * LargeInteger, NativeInteger<...> and Rational) satisfy all of these
 * requirements, and will set \a ring to \c true by default.
 *
 * The header maths/matrixops.h contains several other algorithms that
 * work with the specific class Matrix<Integer>.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.
 *
 * \ifacespython Not present in general, although the specific types
 * Matrix<Integer> and Matrix<bool> are available under the names
 * MatrixInt and MatrixBool respectively.
 *
 * \tparam T the type of each individual matrix element.
 * \tparam ring \c true if we should enable member functions that only
 * work when T represents an element of a ring.  This has a sensible default;
 * see above in the class documentation for details.
