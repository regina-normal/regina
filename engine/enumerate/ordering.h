 * Mathematics of Computation 79 (2010), 453-484.
 *
 * This comparison object is used to sort hyperplanes into a good
 * order before enumerating vertex or fundamental normal surfaces
 * A hyperplane is described by a row of the \a subspace matrix,
 * as passed to an enumeration routine such as
 * DoubleDescription::enumerate() or HilbertDual::enumerate().
 *
 * The ordering is defined as follows.  For each hyperplane, we
 * create a _position vector_ (h_1, ..., h_f), where h_i is 0 if the
 * hyperplane contains the ith coordinate axis, or 1 if not.
 * We then compare these position vectors lexicographically.
 *
 * A PosOrder object behaves like a reference: it is lightweight and can be
 * copy-constructed cheaply, but it does not support assignments or swaps.
