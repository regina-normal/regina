class HilbertCD {
    public:
        /**
         * Determines the Hilbert basis that generates all integer
         * points in the intersection of the <i>n</i>-dimensional
         * non-negative orthant with some linear subspace.
         * The resulting basis elements will be of the class \a RayClass,
         * and will be passed into the given action function one at a time.
         *
         * The non-negative orthant is an <i>n</i>-dimensional cone with
         * its vertex at the origin.  The extremal rays of this cone are
         * the \a n non-negative coordinate axes.  This cone also has \a n
         * facets, where the <i>i</i>th facet is the non-negative
         * orthant of the plane perpendicular to the <i>i</i>th coordinate
         * axis.
         *
         * This routine takes a linear subspace, defined by the
         * intersection of a set of hyperplanes through the origin (this
         * subspace is described as a matrix, with each row giving the
         * equation for one hyperplane).
         *
         * The purpose of this routine is to compute the Hilbert basis of
         * the set of all integer points in the intersection of the
         * original cone with this linear subspace.  The resulting list
         * of basis vectors will contain no duplicates or redundancies.
         *
         * The parameter \a constraints may contain a set of validity
         * constraints, in which case this routine will only return \e valid
         * basis elements.  Each validity constraint is of the form "at
         * most one of these coordinates may be non-zero"; see the
         * ValidityConstraints class for details.  These contraints have the
         * important property that, although validity is not preserved under
         * addition, \e invalidity is.
         *
         * For each of the resulting basis elements, this routine will call
         * \a action (which must be a function or some other callable object).
         * This action should return \c void, and must take exactly one
         * argument, which will be the basis element stored using \a RayClass.
         * The argument will be passed as an rvalue; a typical \a action
         * would take it as an rvalue reference (RayClass&&) and move its
         * contents into some other more permanent storage.
         *
         * \pre The template argument RayClass is derived from (or equal to)
         * Vector<T>, where \a T is one of Regina's arbitrary-precision
         * integer classes (Integer or LargeInteger).
         *
         * \warning For normal surface theory, the Contejean-Devie algorithm is
         * extremely slow, even when modified to incorporate admissibility
         * constraints.  Consider using the much faster HilbertPrimal or
         * HilbertDual instead.
         *
         * \ifacespython There are two versions of this function available
         * in Python.  The first version is the same as the C++ function;
         * here you must pass \a action, which may be a pure Python function.
         * The second form does not have an \a action argument; instead you
         * call <tt>enumerate(subspace, constraints)</tt>,
         * and it returns a Python list containing all Hilbert basis elements.
         * In both versions, the argument \a RayClass is fixed as VectorInt.
         *
         * @param action a function (or other callable object) that will be
         * called for each basis element.  This function must take a single
         * argument, which will be passed as an rvalue of type RayClass.
         * @param subspace a matrix defining the linear subspace to intersect
         * with the given cone.  Each row of this matrix is the equation
         * for one of the hyperplanes whose intersection forms this linear
         * subspace.  The number of columns in this matrix must be the
         * dimension of the overall space in which we are working.
         * @param constraints a set of validity constraints as described above,
         * or ValidityConstraints::none if none should be imposed.
