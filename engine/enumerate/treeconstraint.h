 * A base class for additional linear constraints that we can add to the
 * tableaux of normal surface or angle structure matching equations.  This is
 * used with TreeEnumeration, TreeSingleSoln and related algorithms for
 * enumerating and locating normal surfaces or angle structures in a
 * 3-manifold triangulation.  See the LPInitialTableaux class notes for
 * details on how these constraints interact with the tableaux of
 * matching equations.
 *
 * The linear constraints may be equalities or inequalities, and there
 * may be more than one such constraint.  If all constraints are
 * homogeneous equalities, the class should derive from LPConstraintSubspace
 * instead (not this base class).
 *
 * In angle structure coordinates, these linear constraints must \e not
 * involve the scaling coordinate (the final coordinate that is used to
 * convert the angle structure polytope into a polyhedral cone).
 * The coefficient for the final scaling coordinate in each additional
 * linear constraint will be assumed to be zero.
 *
 * Bear in mind that the tableaux that these constraints are working with will
 * not necessarily use the same coordinates as the underlying enumeration task
 * (e.g., the tableaux will never include separate columns for octagon
 * coordinates).  See LPInitialTableaux for a more detailed discussion of this.
 *
 * This base class provides no functionality.  For documentation's sake
 * only, the notes here describe the functionality that any subclass
 * \e must implement.  We note again that LPConstraintBase does not
 * provide any implementations at all, and subclasses are completely
 * responsible for their own implementations.
 *
 * All constraint classes provide their functionality through static routines:
 * they do not contain any member data, and it is unnecessary (but harmless) to
 * construct them.
 *
 * These linear constraint classes are designed mainly to act as C++ template
 * arguments, and end users will typically not need to construct their own
 * object of these classes.  Instead, to use a linear constraint class, pass it
 * as a template parameter to one of the tree traversal subclasses
 * (e.g., TreeEnumeration, TreeSingleSolution, or TautEnumeration).
 *
 * \ifacespython This base class is not present, but all of the "real" linear
 * constraint subclasses are available.  However, as noted above, it is rare
 * that you would need to access any of these constraint classes directly
 * through Python.  Instead, to use a linear constraint class, you would
 * typically create a tree traversal object with the appropriate class suffix
 * (e.g., one such Python class is \c TreeEnumeration_NonSpun).

         * The LPData class offers support for octagonal almost normal
         * surfaces, in which exactly one tetrahedron is allowed to have
         * exactly one octagon type.  We represent such an octagon as a

         * of the octagon type is not just the sum of coefficients of the
         * two constituent quadrilateral types).  This constant effectively
         * allows us to adjust the tableaux accordingly.
         *
         * Specifically: for each of the two quadrilateral columns being

         * \a nConstraints > 1) then they can all be adjusted in the same way.

         * coefficient data.
         *
         * More precisely: recall that, for each linear function, the initial

         * function f(x).  This routine must create the corresponding row that

         * coordinates, and it must also set a coefficient of -1 in the
         * column for the corresponding new variable.

         * As described in the LPInitialTableaux class notes, it might not be

         * described below, and the corresponding constraint class
         * \e must mention this possibility in its class documentation.
         *

         * linear constraints must not interact with the scaling coordinate
         * (the final angle structure coordinate that is used to projectivise
         * the angle structure polytope into a polyhedral cone).  Your
         * implementation of this routine \e must ensure that your
         * linear constraints all have coefficient zero in this column.
         *
         * The precise form of the linear function(s) will typically depend

         * permutation of columns (LPInitialTableaux.columnPerm()).
         *

         * must be an array of objects of type LPCol<Sub>, and the tableaux

         * LPCol::extra.  You may assume that these coefficients have all been
         * initialised to zero by the LPCol constructor.
         *
         * \pre For all columns in the array \a col, the members
         * LPCol::extra have all been initialised to zero.
         *
         * \exception InvalidArgument it was not possible to create the
         * linear functions for these constraints, due to an error which
         * should have been preventable with the right checks in advance.
         * Any constraint class that could throw exceptions in this way
         * \e must describe this behaviour in its own class documentation.

         * own class documentation.

/**
 * A base class for additional banning and marking constraints that we
 * can place on tree traversal algorithms.  This is used with
 * TreeEnumeration, TreeSingleSoln and related algorithms for
 * enumerating and locating normal surfaces and angle structures in a
 * 3-manifold triangulation.
 *
 * This class adds constraints of two types:
 *
 * - \e Banning constraints, which ensure that certain coordinates
 *   are set to zero;
 *
 * - \e Marking constraints, which are more flexible and can be used in
 *   different ways by different algorithms.
 *
 * All of these constraints operate only on normal or angle structure
 * coordinates in the underlying tableaux (and in particular not the
 * additional variables introduced by additional linear constraints,
 * as described by LPConstraintBase and its subclasses).
 *
 * Currently marking is used in the following ways:
 *
 * - The TreeEnumeration and TautEnumeration algorithms do not use marking
 *   at all.
 *
 * - In the TreeSingleSoln algorithm, marking affects what is considered
 *   a non-trivial normal surface.  Normally, a non-trivial surface is defined
 *   to be one in which some triangle coordinate is zero.  With marking,
 *   a non-trivial surface is redefined to be one in which some \e unmarked
 *   triangle coordinate is zero.  In other words, marked triangle types
 *   are effectively ignored when determining whether a surface is non-trivial
 *   or not.
 *
 * At present, marking is not used at all for quadrilateral coordinates
 * or angle structures.  However, marking is a very new feature, and this
 * concept may be expanded in future versions of Regina.
 *
 * This class does not record disc types in the order of their normal or
 * angle structure coordinates; instead it records them in the order of their
 * columns in a tableaux for linear programming (as used in LPInitialTableaux).
 * This means that there is a little more work required in setting up
 * the initial lists of banned and marked columns, but then these lists are
 * easy to use on the fly during tree traversal algorithms.
 *
 * Bear in mind that the tableaux that these constraints are working with will
 * not necessarily use the same coordinates as the underlying enumeration task
 * (e.g., the tableaux will never include separate columns for octagon
 * coordinates).  See LPInitialTableaux for a more detailed discussion of this.
 *
 * This base class provides limited functionality (as documented below).
 * Subclasses \e must implement a constructor (which, like this base
 * class, takes an initial tableaux and determines which coordinates are
 * banned and/or marked), and must implement supported(), which indicates
 * which normal or angle structure coordinate system this constraint class
 * can work with.
 *
 * These ban constraint classes are designed mainly to act as C++ template
 * arguments, and end users will typically not need to construct their own
 * object of these classes.  Instead, to use a ban constraint class, pass it
 * as a template parameter to one of the tree traversal subclasses
 * (e.g., TreeEnumeration, TreeSingleSolution, or TautEnumeration).
 *
 * \ifacespython This base class is not present, but all subclasses are
 * available.  However, as noted above, it is rare that you would need
 * to access any of these ban constraint classes directly through Python.
 * Instead, to use a ban constraint class, you would typically create
 * a tree traversal object with the appropriate class suffix (e.g., one
 * such Python class is \c TreeEnumeration_BanBoundary).
