/**
 * Implements a modified primal algorithm for enumerating Hilbert bases.
 * This incorporates the primal algorithm described in
 * "Normaliz: Algorithms for affine monoids and rational cones",
 * Winfried Bruns and Bogdan Ichim, J. Algebra 324 (2010), 1098-1113,
 * and has been modified to allow for additional constraints (such as
 * the quadrilateral constraints from normal surface theory).
 *
 * To summarise: the algorithm first enumerates extremal rays of the rational
 * cone, and then decomposes the admissible region of the cone (where the
 * extra constraints are satisfied) into maximal admissible faces.
 * It calls Normaliz directly to enumerate the Hilbert basis for
 * each maximal admissible faces, and finally combines these into a basis
 * for the entire space.
 *
 * All routines of interest within this class are static; no object of
 * this class should ever be created.

    public:
        /**
         * Determines the Hilbert basis that generates all integer
         * points in the intersection of the <i>n</i>-dimensional
         * non-negative orthant with some linear subspace.
         * The resulting basis elements will be of the class \a RayClass,
         * and will be passed into the given action function one at a time.
         *
         * The intersection of the non-negative orthant with this linear
         * subspace is a pointed polyhedral cone with apex at the origin,
         * and this routine requires the extremal rays of this cone to
         * be provided as input.  The extremal rays can be computed
         * using DoubleDescription::enumerate() in general cases,
         * though sometimes (such as with normal surface theory) more
         * efficient methods are available.
         *
         * This routine computes the Hilbert basis of all integer points in
         * this cone.  The resulting list of basis vectors will contain
         * no duplicates or redundancies.
         *
         * The parameter \a constraints may contain a set of validity
         * constraints, in which case this routine will only return \e valid
         * basis elements.  Each validity constraint is of the form "at
         * most one of these coordinates may be non-zero"; see the
         * ValidityConstraints class for details.  These contraints have the
         * important property that, although validity is not preserved under
         * addition, \e invalidity is.
         *
         * An optional progress tracker may be passed.  If so, this routine
         * will update the percentage progress and poll for cancellation
         * requests.  It will be assumed that an appropriate stage has already
         * been declared via ProgressTracker::newStage() before this routine
         * is called, and that ProgressTracker::setFinished() will be
         * called after this routine returns.
         *
         * For each of the resulting basis elements, this routine will call
         * \a action (which must be a function or some other callable object).
         * This action should return \c void, and must take exactly one
         * argument, which will be the basis element stored using \a RayClass.
         * The argument will be passed as an rvalue; a typical \a action
         * would take it as an rvalue reference (RayClass&&) and move its
         * contents into some other more permanent storage.
         *
         * \pre If \a constraints is passed, then the given list of
         * extremal rays contains \e only those extremal rays that satisfy
         * all of the given constraints.
         * \pre The template argument RayClass is derived from (or equal to)
         * Vector<T>, where \a T is one of Regina's arbitrary-precision
         * integer classes (Integer or LargeInteger).
         * \pre The template argument RayIterator is a forward iterator type,
         * and when dereferenced has the interface of a constant vector of
         * Regina's arbitrary-precision integers (i.e., the elements of the
         * vector must be of type Integer or LargeInteger).  For example, it
         * might dereference to a (const Vector<Integer>&), or a
         * (const std::vector<LargeInteger>&).
         * The vector interface required is minimal (just a bracket operator
         * and a size() function), and in particular both std::vector and
         * regina::Vector will suffice for this.
         *
         * \warning If a progress tracker is passed, be aware that the
         * present implementation updates percentage progress very infrequently,
         * and may take a very long time to honour cancellation requests.
         *
         * \ifacespython There are two versions of this function available
         * in Python.  The first version is
         * <tt>enumerate(action, rays, constraints, tracker)</tt>, which
         * mirrors the C++ function; here \a action may be a pure Python
         * function.  The second version does not have an \a action argument;
         * instead you call <tt>enumerate(rays, constraints, tracker)</tt>,
         * and it returns a Python list containing all Hilbert basis elements.
         * In both versions, the extremal rays must be passed as a Python list
         * of VectorInt objects, and the output type \a RayClass is likewise
         * fixed as VectorInt.
         *
         * @param action a function (or other callable object) that will be
         * called for each basis element.  This function must take a single
         * argument, which will be passed as an rvalue of type RayClass.
         * @param raysBegin an iterator pointing to the beginning of the
         * list of extremal rays.
         * @param raysEnd an iterator pointing past the end of the
         * list of extremal rays.
         * @param constraints a set of validity constraints as described above,
         * or ValidityConstraints::none if none should be imposed.
         * @param tracker a progress tracker through which progress
         * will be reported, or \c null if no progress reporting is required.
