/**
 * Represents a closed graph manifold formed by joining a
 * single bounded Seifert fibred space to itself along a torus.
 *
 * The Seifert fibred space must have two boundary components, each a
 * torus corresponding to a puncture in the base orbifold (with no
 * fibre-reversing twist as one travels around the boundary).
 *
 * The way in which the two torus boundaries are joined together is specified
 * by a 2-by-2 matrix \a M.  This matrix relates the locations of the fibres
 * and base orbifold on the two boundary tori.
 *
 * More specifically, suppose that \a f0 and \a o0 are generators of the
 * first boundary torus, where \a f0 represents a directed fibre in the
 * Seifert fibred space and \a o0 represents the oriented boundary of
 * the base orbifold.  Likewise, let \a f1 and \a o1 be generators of the
 * second boundary torus representing a directed fibre and the oriented
 * boundary of the base orbifold.  Then the tori are joined together so
 * that the curves \a f0, \a o0, \a f1 and \a o1 become related as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     [f1]       [f0]
 *     [  ] = M * [  ]
 *     [o1]       [o0]
 * </pre>
 *
 * See the page on \ref sfsnotation for details on some of the
 * terminology used above.
 *
 * The optional Manifold routine homology() is implemented, but
 * the optional routine construct() is not.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.  Note, however, that
 * GraphLoop still requires a non-trivial (but constant sized) amount of data
 * to be copied even in a move operation.
 *
 * \todo \opt Speed up homology calculations involving orientable base
 * spaces by adding rank afterwards, instead of adding generators for
 * genus into the presentation matrix.
