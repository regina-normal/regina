/**
 * Represents a general lens space.
 *
 * The lens space L(\a p,\a q) is the 3-manifold you get by
 * \a p/q Dehn surgery on the unknot.  For instance, L(1,0) and L(1,1)
 * are the 3-sphere, L(0,1) is the product S^1 x S^2, and L(\a p,1) is the
 * circle bundle over S^2 with Euler class \a p.  In L(\a p,\a q) if you
 * take a generator \a g of H_1 and evaluate the torsion linking form on it,
 * then &lt;\a g,\a g&gt; = [+/- \a r^2 \a q/\a p] in Q/Z where \a r is an
 * integer.
 *
 * All optional Manifold routines are implemented for this class.
 *
 * This class supports copying but does not implement separate move operations,
 * since its internal data is so small that copying is just as efficient.
 * It implements the C++ Swappable requirement via its own member and global
 * swap() functions, for consistency with the other manifold classes.
 *
