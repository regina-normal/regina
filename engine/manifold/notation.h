/*! \page sfsnotation Notation for Seifert fibred spaces
 *
 *  Consider a Seifert fibred space over some base orbifold, containing
 *  one or more exceptional fibres and optionally one or more boundary
 *  components.  Here we describe the notation used for the exceptional
 *  fibres, as well as their relationship to curves on the boundary
 *  components.
 *
 *  Consider the illustration below.  Here the base orbifold is
 *  an annulus, with boundary components at the top and bottom of the
 *  diagram.  The two circles in the middle correspond to two
 *  exceptional fibres.
 *
 *  \image html sfsnotation.png
 *
 *  The boundary curves \a o1 and \a o2, as well as the curves \a e1 and
 *  \a e2 bounding the exceptional fibres, can be given consistent
 *  orientations as illustrated by the arrows.  The fibres can also be
 *  consistently oriented; let them be parallel copies of some curve \a f.
 *
 *  Suppose that we describe the space as having exceptional fibres
 *  with parameters (\a p1, \a q1) and (\a p2, \a q2).  This corresponds
 *  to removing all fibres inside curves \a e1 and \a e2, and filling
 *  the resulting boundaries with solid tori whose meridinal curves are
 *  (\a p1 * \a e1 + \a q1 * \a f) and (\a p2 * \a e2 + \a q2 * \a f).
 *
 *  An obstruction constant of \a b is treated as an additional
 *  exceptional fibre with parameters (1, \a b) according to the
 *  description above.
 *
 *  Where necessary, we use the oriented curves \a o1 and \a o2 as
 *  curves on the boundaries _representing the base orbifold_,
 *  and parallel copies of \a f as curves on the boundaries
 *  _representing the fibres_.  This becomes particularly
 *  important when joining different boundary components together.
 *
 *  It is worth noting the following observation.  Suppose we have a
 *  Seifert fibred space with boundary, and let one of its
 *  boundary components have oriented curves (\a f, \a o) representing the
 *  fibres and base orbifold respectively.  Then exactly the same space can
 *  be written with an additional (1,1) fibre (i.e., the obstruction
 *  constant \a b is incremented by one), with the effect that the
 *  curves on that boundary representing the fibres and base orbifold
 *  become (\a f, \a o + \a f) instead.
