/**
 * Represents a general Seifert fibred space, which may be orientable or
 * non-orientable.  Punctures and reflector boundaries in the base orbifold
 * are supported.
 *
 * A Seifert fibred space whose base orbifold has no punctures or
 * reflector boundaries can be placed into one of the six classes
 * \c o1, \c o2, \c n1, \c n2, \c n3 and \c n4, as detailed on page 88
 * of "Seifert Manifolds", Peter Orlik, Springer-Verlag, 1972.
 * These classes describe whether this base surface is orientable, as well
 * as how many of its generators give fibre-reversing paths in the 3-manifold.
 *
 * In the case where the base orbifold has punctures and/or reflector
 * boundaries, we use the five simplified classes \c bo1, \c bo2, \c bn1,
 * \c bn2 and \c bn3.  These classes are not standard terminology (i.e.,
 * they have been created explicitly for Regina), and generally they do not
 * provide enough information to uniquely identify the 3-manifold.  They do
 * however identify whether or not the base orbifold is orientable,
 * and whether or not it contains any fibre-reversing paths.
 *
 * When describing punctures and reflector boundaries, a \e twisted
 * boundary is one that gives a fibre-reversing path, and an \e untwisted
 * boundary is one around which the direction of fibres is preserved.
 *
 * Exceptional fibres are sorted first by \a alpha (the index) and then
 * by \a beta.  The obstruction constant \a b is stored separately,
 * though in output routines such as name() and structure() it is
 * merged in with the exceptional fibres.  Specifically, it is merged in
 * with the \a beta of the final exceptional fibre (replacing it with
 * <tt>beta + b.alpha</tt>), or if there are no exceptional fibres then
 * it is presented as a single (1,b) fibre.
 *
 * The Manifold routines homology() and construct() are only
 * implemented in some cases.  The homology() routine is
 * implemented if and only if the base orbifold has no punctures.
 * The construct() routine is implemented only for lens spaces and
 * Seifert fibred spaces over the 2-sphere without punctures or reflector
 * boundaries.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.  Note, however, that
 * SFSpace still requires a non-trivial (but constant sized) amount of data to
 * be copied even in a move operation.
 *
 * \warning In Regina 4.2.1 and earlier, this class was named NSFS.
 * As of Regina 4.3, this class was renamed due to significant changes of
 * behaviour (it became more general, and also now keeps the obstruction
 * parameter \a b separate).  Code that was written to work with the old
 * NSFS class should be looked at closely before being adapted to the new
 * SFSpace class (i.e., it may require more than just substituting class names).
 *
 * \todo \featurelong Implement recognition of more common names.
 * \todo \featurelong Implement triangulation construction and homology
 * calculation for more Seifert fibred spaces.
