/**
 * The default signature type to use for isomorphism signatures.
 *
 * This signature type is consistent with the original isomorphism signatures
 * that were implemented in Regina 4.90.
 *
 * A signature type class such as this works with a single component \a c of
 * a <i>dim</i>-dimenensional triangulation.  The sole task of a type class
 * is to iterate through a selection of combinations (\a s, \a p), each
 * of which identifies a "starting simplex" and a "starting labelling"
 * of its vertices.  Here \a s is a top-dimensional simplex in \a c that
 * will act as the "starting simplex", and \a p is a permutation that maps
 * the vertices of \a s to the "starting labelling" 0,1,...,\a dim.
 *
 * The properties that any signature type must satisfy are:
 *
 * - The selection of combinations (\a s, \a p) is always non-empty.
 *
 * - If we reorder the top-dimensional simplices of \a c and/or relabel
 *   their individual vertices, then the combinations (\a s, \a p) that
 *   this type class produces will be the same set, but modified
 *   according to this reordering/relabelling.  In other words, the
 *   starting simplices and their starting labellings can in theory
 *   be completely deduced from an \e unlabelled triangulation component.
 *
 * An instance of a type class is like an iterator: it holds a
 * single candidate combination (\a s, \a p).  The constructor must
 * initialise the instance to store the first candidate combination; you
 * can then query the current combination by calling simplex() and perm(),
 * and you can advance to the next combination by calling next().
 *
 * This classic signature type is trivial, in that it considers \a all
 * possible simplices \a s and all <tt>(dim+1)!</tt> possible permutations \a p.
 *
 * This class is designed to be used as a template parameter for
 * Triangulation<dim>::isoSig() and Triangulation<dim>::isoSigDetail().
 * Typical users would have no need to create objects of this class or
 * call any of its functions directly.
 *
 * \ifacespython Python does not support templates.  Instead this class
 * can be used by appending the dimension as a suffix (e.g.,
 * IsoSigClassic2 and IsoSigClassic3 for dimensions 2 and 3).
