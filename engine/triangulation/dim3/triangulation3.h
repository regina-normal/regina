         *
         * The initial data for the Turaev-Viro invariant is as described in
         * the paper of Turaev and Viro, "State sum invariants of 3-manifolds
         * and quantum 6j-symbols", Topology, vol. 31, no. 4, 1992, pp 865-902.
         * In particular, Section 7 of this paper describes the initial data
         * as determined by an integer r >= 3, and a root of unity q0 of
         * degree 2r for which q0^2 is a primitive root of unity of
         * degree r.  There are several cases to consider:
         *
         * - \a r may be even.  In this case \a q0 must be a primitive
         *   (<i>2r</i>)th root of unity, and the invariant is computed as an
         *   element of the cyclotomic field of order \a 2r.  There is no need
         *   to specify \e which root of unity is used, since switching between
         *   different roots of unity corresponds to an automorphism of
         *   the underlying cyclotomic field (i.e., it does not yield
         *   any new information).  Therefore, if \a r is even, the
         *   additional argument \a parity is ignored.
         *
         * - \a r may be odd, and \a q0 may be a primitive (<i>2r</i>)th
         *   root of unity.  This case corresponds to passing the argument
         *   \a parity as \c true.  Here the invariant is again computed
         *   as an element of the cyclotomic field of order \a 2r.  As before,
         *   there is no need to give further information as to which
         *   root of unity is used, since switching between roots of unity
         *   does not yield new information.
         *
         * - \a r may be odd, and \a q0 may be a primitive (<i>r</i>)th
         *   root of unity.  This case corresponds to passing the argument
         *   \a parity as \c false.  In this case the invariant is computed
         *   as an element of the cyclotomic field of order \a r.  Again,
         *   there is no need to give further information as to which
         *   root of unity is used.
         *
         * This routine works entirely within the relevant cyclotomic field,
         * which yields exact results but adds a significant overhead to the
         * running time.  If you want a fast floating-point approximation,
         * you can call turaevViroApprox() instead.
         *
         * Unlike this routine, turaevViroApprox() requires a precise
         * specification of which root of unity is used (since it
         * returns a numerical real value).  The numerical value
         * obtained by calling
         * <tt>turaevViroApprox(r, whichRoot)</tt>
         * should be the same as
         * <tt>turaevViro(r, parity).evaluate(whichRoot)</tt>,
         * where \a parity is \c true or \c false according to whether
         * \a whichRoot is odd or even respectively.  Of course in practice the
         * numerical values might be very different, since turaevViroApprox()
         * performs significantly more floating point operations, and so is
         * subject to a much larger potential numerical error.
         *
         * If the requested Turaev-Viro invariant has already been computed,
         * then the result will be cached and so this routine will be
         * very fast (since it just returns the previously computed result).
         * Otherwise the computation could be quite slow, particularly
         * for larger triangulations and/or larger values of \a r.
         * This (potentially) long computation can be managed by passing
         * a progress tracker:
         *
         * - If a progress tracker is passed and the requested invariant has
         *   not yet been computed, then the calculation will take place in a
         *   new thread and this routine will return immediately.  Once the
         *   progress tracker indicates that the calculation has finished,
         *   you can call turaevViro() again with the same arguments for
         *   \a r and \a parity to retrieve the value of the invariant.
         *
         * - If no progress tracker is passed and the requested invariant has
         *   not yet been computed, the calculation will run in the current
         *   thread and this routine will not return until it is complete.
         *
         * - If the requested invariant has already been computed, then this
         *   routine will return immediately with the pre-computed value.  If
