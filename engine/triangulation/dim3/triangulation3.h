         *   the underlying cyclotomic field (i.e., it does not yield
         *   any new information).  Therefore, if \a r is even, the
         *   additional argument \a parity is ignored.
         *
         * - \a r may be odd, and \a q0 may be a primitive (<i>2r</i>)th
         *   root of unity.  This case corresponds to passing the argument
         *   \a parity as \c true.  Here the invariant is again computed
         *   as an element of the cyclotomic field of order \a 2r.  As before,
         *   there is no need to give further information as to which
         *   root of unity is used, since switching between roots of unity
         *   does not yield new information.
         *
         * - \a r may be odd, and \a q0 may be a primitive (<i>r</i>)th
         *   root of unity.  This case corresponds to passing the argument
         *   \a parity as \c false.  In this case the invariant is computed
         *   as an element of the cyclotomic field of order \a r.  Again,
         *   there is no need to give further information as to which
         *   root of unity is used.

         * This routine works entirely within the relevant cyclotomic field,
         * which yields exact results but adds a significant overhead to the
         * running time.  If you want a fast floating-point approximation,
         * you can call turaevViroApprox() instead.
         *
         * Unlike this routine, turaevViroApprox() requires a precise
         * specification of which root of unity is used (since it
         * returns a numerical real value).  The numerical value
         * obtained by calling
         * <tt>turaevViroApprox(r, whichRoot)</tt>

         * where \a parity is \c true or \c false according to whether
         * \a whichRoot is odd or even respectively.  Of course in practice the
         * numerical values might be very different, since turaevViroApprox()
         * performs significantly more floating point operations, and so is
         * subject to a much larger potential numerical error.
         *
         * If the requested Turaev-Viro invariant has already been computed,
         * then the result will be cached and so this routine will be

         *   the triangulation and \e an isomorphism signature.
         *   The second form is offered in order to avoid unnecessary
         *   recomputation within the \a action function; however, note that
         *   the signature might not be of the IsoSigClassic type (i.e., it
         *   might not match the output from the default version of isoSig()).
         *   If there are any additional arguments supplied in the list \a args,
         *   then these will be passed as subsequent arguments to \a action.
         *
         * - The triangulation argument will be passed as an rvalue; a typical
         *   action could (for example) take it by const reference and query it,
         *   or take it by value and modify it, or take it by rvalue reference
         *   and move it into more permanent storage.
         *
         * - \a action must return a boolean.  If \a action ever returns
         *   \c true, then this indicates that processing should stop
         *   immediately (i.e., no more triangulations will be processed).
         *

         *   subsequent changes (if any) were made.

         *   (including this starting triangulation).  In other words, no

         * This operation can be performed on \e any internal edge,
         * without further constraints.  Two particularly useful settings are:
         *
         * - If the edge joins an internal vertex with some different vertex
         *   (which may be internal, boundary, ideal or invalid), then
         *   this move does not change the topology of the manifold at all,
         *   and it reduces the total number of vertices by one.  In
         *   this sense, it acts as an alternative to collapseEdge(),
         *   and unlike collapseEdge() it can \e always be performed.
         *
         * - If the edge runs from an internal vertex back to itself,
         *   then this move effectively drills out the edge, leaving
         *   an ideal torus or Klein bottle boundary component.
         *
         * We do not allow \a e to lie entirely on the triangulation boundary,
         * because the implementation actually collapses an internal curve
         * \e parallel to \a e, not the edge \a e itself (and so if \a e is a
         * boundary edge then the topological effect would not be as intended).
         * We do allow \a e to be an internal edge with both endpoints on the
         * boundary, but note that in this case the resulting topological
         * operation would render the triangulation invalid.
         *
         * If you are trying to reduce the number of vertices without changing
         * the topology, and if \a e is an edge connecting an internal vertex
         * with some different vertex, then either collapseEdge() or pinchEdge()
         * may be more appropriate for your situation.
         *
         * - The advantage of collapseEdge() is that it decreases the
         *   number of tetrahedra, whereas pinchEdge() increases this
         *   number (but only by two).
         *
         * - The disadvantages of collapseEdge() are that it cannot always be
         *   performed, and its validity tests are expensive; pinchEdge() on
         *   the other hand can always be used for edges \a e of the
         *   type described above.
         *

         * Dehydration strings come with some restrictions:
         * - They rely on the triangulation being "canonical" in some
         *   combinatorial sense.  This is not enforced here; instead
         *   a combinatorial isomorphism is applied to make the
         *   triangulation canonical, and this isomorphic triangulation
         *   is dehydrated instead.  Note that the original triangulation
         *   is not changed.
         * - They require the triangulation to be connected.
         * - They require the triangulation to have no boundary triangles
         *   (though ideal triangulations are fine).
         * - They can only support triangulations with at most 25 tetrahedra.
         *
         * The routine rehydrate() can be used to recover a
         * triangulation from a dehydration string.  Note that the
         * triangulation recovered <b>might not be identical</b> to the
         * original, but it is guaranteed to be an isomorphic copy.
