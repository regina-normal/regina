         * This routine is fast (it uses a pre-computed triangulation if
         * possible).  The downside is that the triangulation is read-only
         * (though you can always clone it).
         *
         * Regarding the labelling of triangles in the vertex link:
         *
         * - The triangles of the vertex link are numbered as follows.
         *   Let \a i lie between 0 and degree()-1 inclusive, let
         *   \a tet represent `embedding(i).tetrahedron()`,
         *   and let \a v represent `embedding(i).vertex()`.
         *   Then `buildLink()->triangle(i)` is the triangle
         *   in the vertex link that "slices off" vertex \a v from
         *   tetrahedron \a tet.  In other words,
         *   `buildLink()->triangle(i)` in the vertex link
         *   is parallel to triangle `tet->triangle(v)` in the
         *   surrounding 3-manifold triangulation.
         *
         * - The vertices of each triangle in the vertex link are
         *   numbered as follows.  Following the discussion above,
         *   suppose that `buildLink()->triangle(i)` sits within
         *   \c tet and is parallel to `tet->triangle(v)`.
         *   Then vertices 0,1,2 of the triangle in the link will be
         *   parallel to vertices 0,1,2 of the corresponding Triangle<3>.
         *   The permutation `tet->triangleMapping(v)` will map
         *   vertices 0,1,2 of the triangle in the link to the
         *   corresponding vertices of \c tet (those opposite \c v),
         *   and will map 3 to \c v itself.
         *
         * - If you need this labelling data in a format that is easy to
         *   compute with, you can call buildLinkInclusion() to retrieve
         *   this information as an isomorphism.
         *
         * \python Since Python does not distinguish between const and
         * non-const, this routine will return by value (thus making a
         * deep copy of the vertex link).  You are free to modify the
         * triangulation that is returned.

         *
         * The documentation for buildLink() describes in plain English
         * exactly how the vertex link will be triangulated.  This function
         * essentially returns the same information in a machine-readable form.
         *
         * Specifically, this function returns an Isomorphism<3> that describes
         * how the individual triangles of the link sit within the tetrahedra
         * of the original triangulation.  If \a p is the isomorphism returned,

         * \a tet of the 3-manifold triangulation contains the <i>i</i>th
         * triangle of the link.  Moreover, `p.facePerm(i)` will

         * it will send 3 to the vertex of \a t that the triangle links,

         * parallel to vertices 0,1,2 of this triangle.
