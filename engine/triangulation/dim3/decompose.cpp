        // ---> the boundary of D separates the boundary of P into two pieces
        //      A and B; and
        // ---> D itself is non-separating, so there exists a closed curve c
        //      in P that meets D exactly once.
        // Our goal is to show that this, in combination with what we know
        // about the homology of P, leads to a contradiction.
        //
        // We first consider the case where P is the original triangulation.
        // Let g and h denote the genus of A and B, respectively, so that the
        // boundary of P has genus g+h. At the beginning of the algorithm, we
        // verified that the homology of P is (g+h)Z. With this in mind, take
        // the union of A and D, and push this slightly off the boundary to
        // obtain a closed genus-g surface S in P that meets the closed curve
        // c exactly once. Let X' be a small neighbourhood of the union of S
        // and c, and let Y' be the space given by removing the interior of X
        // from P. The intersection of X and Y is a surface R of genus 2g.
        // Let N be a thickening of R, let X be the union of X' and N, and
        // let Y be the union of Y' and N; this gives subspaces X and Y whose
        // interiors cover P, and the intersection of these two subspaces is
        // exactly N. Thus, letting G = H1(X)+H1(Y), we have the following
        // exact sequence (the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the pair of
        // subspaces X and Y):
        //                        p       q
        //      ... ----> H1(N) ----> G ----> H1(P) ----> ...
        // We make the following homological observations:
        // ---> H1(N) = (4g)Z, because N retracts to a surface of genus 2g.
        // ---> H1(X) = (2g+1)Z, because X retracts to the union of S and c.
        // ---> H1(Y) has rank at least 2g+(g+h) because it has two boundary
        //      components, one of which has genus 2g, while the other has
        //      genus g+h.
        // ---> Thus, G has rank at least (4g+1)+(g+h)
        // ---> H1(P) = (g+h)Z, by assumption.
        // Notice that im(q) must be a free abelian group (of rank at most
        // g+h), which implies that G is isomorphic to ker(q)+im(q). Thus,
        // ker(q) must have rank at least 4g+1. By exactness, im(p) must also
        // have rank at least 4g+1, which is impossible since H1(N) only has
        // rank 4g.
        //
        // It remains to consider the case where P was obtained by some
        // sequence of crushing operations. Topologically, we know that P
        // was obtained from the original triangulation by cutting along
        // properly embedded discs. This implies that the homology of P is
        // kZ, where k is the genus of the boundary of P (one way to check
        // that cutting along discs does indeed preserve this property of the
        // homology is to again use Mayer-Vietoris sequences). Thus, by the
