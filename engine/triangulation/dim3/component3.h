 * This 3-dimensional specialisation contains some extra functionality.
 * In particular, each 3-dimensional component also stores details on
 * lower-dimensional faces (i.e., vertices, edges and triangles).
 *
 * Components do not support value semantics: they cannot be copied, swapped,
 * or manually constructed.  Their location in memory defines them, and
 * they are often passed and compared by pointer.  End users are never
 * responsible for their memory management; this is all taken care of by
 * the Triangulation to which they belong.
