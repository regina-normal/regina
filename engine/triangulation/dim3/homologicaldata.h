/**
 * A specialised class that computes a large amount of detailed homological
 * information for a 3-manifold triangulation.
 *
 * This class is both heavyweight and specialised.  If you just wish
 * to compute homology or Euler characteristic, or even map faces of the
 * skeleton to classes in the homology groups, the Triangulation class
 * has simpler and slicker member functions that can do this for you.
 * See for example the Triangulation functions homology(), eulerCharTri(),
 * eulerCharManifold(), and markedHomology().
 *
 * The most important thing that HomologicalData adds is the ability to
 * work with the torsion linking form.  Be aware however that the code that
 * computes the torsion linking form includes some floating-point arithmetic,
 * and this could be subject to round-off error.  Such errors are not expected,
 * since the floating-point code is simply distinguishing different multiples
 * of a known irrational, but nevertheless these results should be considered
 * non-rigorous.
 *
 * Currently, the information computed by HomologicalData includes:
 *
 * - the manifold's homology;
 * - the boundary's homology;
 * - the map from boundary -> manifold;
 * - the dual cellular homology;
 * - the isomorphism on H1 from the dual cellular homology to the regular
 *   cellular homology;
 * - the H1 torsion form;
 * - the Kawauchi-Kojima invariants of torsion linking forms.
 *
 * This class takes a "least effort" approach to all computations. It
 * only computes what is neccessary for your requests.  It also keeps a
 * record of all previous computations you've made. If a computation can
 * be sped up by not recomputing some data, it takes that short-cut.
 *
 * All these algorithms use two transverse CW decompositions of the manifold.
 * They correspond to the (possibly ideal) triangulation native to Regina, 
 * and the dual polyhedral (CW) decomposition which appears in Seifert and
 * Threlfall's textbook.
 *
 * In the following lists we describe the canonical ordering of both the
 * cells and the dual cells of the given triangulation.
 *
 * First we list the cell orderings for the _standard CW decomposition_,
 * which most closely resembles the ideal triangulation.
 *
 * - \b 0-cells: The non-ideal vertices given in the order vertices.begin()
 *               to vertices.end(), followed by the ideal endpoints of the
 *               edges edges.begin() to edges.end() with endpoints
 *               for each edge taken in the order 0,1.
 *
 * - \b 1-cells: edges.begin() to edges.end(), followed by the ideal edges of
 *               faces.begin() to faces.end() in order 0,1,2.
 *
 * - \b 2-cells: faces.begin() to faces.end(), followed by the ideal faces of
 *               tetrahedra.begin() through tetrahedra.end() in order 0,1,2,3.
 *
 * - \b 3-cells: tetrahedra.begin() through tetrahedra.end().
 *
 * Next we list the cell orderings for the _dual CW decomposition_:
 * if the standard CW decomposition came from a morse function \a f, this
 * would be the one for -\a f.
 *
 * - \b 0-cells: tetrahedra.begin() through tetrahedra.end().
 *
 * - \b 1-cells: the non-boundary faces.begin() through faces.end().
 *
 * - \b 2-cells: the non-boundary edges.begin() through edges.end().
 *
 * - \b 3-cells: the non-boundary, non-ideal vertices.begin() through
 *               vertices.end().
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.  Be aware, however, that
 * it contains an enormous amount of internal data, and even moves will
 * still be relatively expensive - you should try to use just the one
 * HomologicalData object and not copy or move it at all, if possible.
 *
 * This class will eventually be removed in a future release of Regina.
