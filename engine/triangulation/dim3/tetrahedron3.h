/**
 * Represents a tetrahedron within a 3-manifold triangulation.
 *
 * This class is typically referred to by the aliases Simplex<3> or
 * Tetrahedron<3> (or, for Python users, \c Simplex3 and \c Tetrahedron3).
 *
 * The class template Face<dim, dim> specialises the generic Face class
 * template in order to work with top-dimensional simplices in a triangulation.
 * This class Face<3, 3> specialises it further to add dimension-specific
 * aliases for dimension 3.
 *
 * See the documentation for the partial specialisation Face<dim, dim> for an
 * overview of how a top-dimensional simplex class works.
 *
 * Tetrahedra do not support value semantics: they cannot be copied, swapped,
 * or manually constructed.  Their location in memory defines them, and
 * they are often passed and compared by pointer.  End users are never
 * responsible for their memory management; this is all taken care of by
 * the Triangulation to which they belong.
