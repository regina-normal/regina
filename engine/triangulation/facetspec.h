/**
 * A lightweight class used to refer to a particular facet of a particular
 * top-dimensional simplex in a <i>dim</i>-dimensional triangulation.
 * Only the simplex index and the facet number are stored.
 *
 * Facilities are provided for iterating through simplex facets.
 * With this in mind, it is also possible to represent the overall
 * boundary, a past-the-end value and a before-the-start value.
 *
 * When iterating through the simplex facets, the facets will be
 * ordered first by simplex index and then by facet number.  The
 * overall boundary appears after all other simplex facets.
 *
 * If there are \a n simplices, the simplices will be numbered from 0
 * to <i>n</i>-1 inclusive.  The boundary will be represented as
 * simplex \a n, facet 0.  The past-the-end value will be represented
 * as simplex \a n, facet 1, and the before-the-start value will be
 * represented as simplex -1, facet \a dim.
 *
 * These objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with std::swap(),
 * with no need for any specialised move operations or swap functions.
 *
 * \ifacespython Python does not support templates.  Instead this class
 * can be used by appending the dimension as a suffix (e.g., FacetSpec2
 * and FacetSpec3 for dimensions 2 and 3).
 *
 * \tparam dim the dimension of the underlying triangulation.
 * This must be between 2 and 15 inclusive.
