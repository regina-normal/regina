/**
 * This class offers static routines for constructing a variety of sample
 * <i>dim</i>-dimensional triangulations.  These triangulations may be useful
 * for testing new code, or for simply getting a feel for how Regina works.
 *
 * In higher dimensions, only a handful of triangulations are available
 * (in contrast to the 3-dimensional class Example<3>, which offers
 * many interesting examples).  The authors hope to expand this list
 * in future releases of Regina.
 *
 * The sample triangulations offered here may prove especially useful in
 * Regina's scripting interface, where working with pre-existing files
 * is more complicated than in the GUI.
 *
 * For Regina's \ref stddim "standard dimensions", this template is
 * specialised and offers many more example triangulations.  In order to
 * use these specialised classes, you will need to include the corresponding
 * headers (e.g., triangulation/example2.h for \a dim = 2, or
 * triangulation/example3.h for \a dim = 3).
 *
 * \ifacespython Python does not support templates.  Instead this class
 * can be used by appending the dimension as a suffix (e.g., Example2
 * and Example3 for dimensions 2 and 3).
 *
 * \tparam dim the dimension of the example triangulations to construct.
 * This must be between 2 and 15 inclusive.
 *
 * \headerfile triangulation/generic.h
