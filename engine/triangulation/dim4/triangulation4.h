 *
 * This 4-dimensional specialisation offers significant extra functionality,

 *
 * A 4-manifold triangulation is built from pentachora: a _pentachoron_ is a
 * 4-dimensional simplex, with five vertices.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.

        /**
         * Snaps together the endpoints of an edge connecting an internal
         * vertex with some different (possibly boundary) vertex, which reduces
         * the number of vertices in this triangulation by one without changing
         * the topology.
         *
         * This operation essentially works by taking a triangle \a t that
         * meets the given edge \a e, and folding the other two edges of \a t
         * together about their common vertex. This can be done if and only
         * if \a e is an edge whose endpoints are distinct and not both
         * boundary (i.e., an edge of the type described above).
         *
         * If the routine is asked to both check and perform, the move
         * will only be performed if the check shows it is legal.
         *
         * Depending on your situation, collapseEdge() may be a more
         * appropriate method for reducing the number of vertices without
         * changing the topology.
         *
         * - The advantage of collapseEdge() is that it decreases the number
         *   of tetrahedra, whereas snapEdge() increases this number (but only
         *   by four).
         *
         * - The disadvantages of collapseEdge() are that it cannot always be
         *   performed, and its validity tests are expensive; snapEdge() on
         *   the other hand can always be used for edges \a e of the type
         *   described above.
         *
         * This operation works by prying open a tetrahedron \a t and inserting
         * a four-pentachoron gadget \a g within the resulting tetrahedral
         * pillow.  In particular, this means that simplex and/or facet locks
         * will never prevent this operation from taking place: if the
         * tetrahedron \a t happens to be locked, then this lock will simply
         * move across to one of the two tetrahedra bounding the gadget \a g.
         *
         * If this triangulation is currently oriented, then this operation
         * will preserve the orientation.
         *
         * Note that after performing this move, all skeletal objects
         * (triangles, components, etc.) will be reconstructed, which means
         * any pointers to old skeletal objects (such as the argument \a e)
         * can no longer be used.
         *
         * \pre If the move is being performed and no check is being run, it
         * must be known in advance that the move is legal.
         * \pre The given edge \a e is an edge of this triangulation.
         *
         * \param e the edge whose endpoints are to be snapped together.
         * \param check \c true if we are to check whether the move is allowed
         * (defaults to \c true).
         * \param perform \c true if we are to perform the move (defaults to
         * \c true).
         * \return If \a check is \c true, the function returns \c true if and
         * only if the requested move may be performed without changing the
         * topology of the manifold. If \a check is \c false, the function
         * simply returns \c true.
