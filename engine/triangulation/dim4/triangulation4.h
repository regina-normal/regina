         *   const std::string& followed by a triangulation, representing both
         *   the triangulation and its isomorphism signature.
         *   The second form is offered in order to avoid unnecessary
         *   recomputation within the \a action function; however, note that
         *   the signature might not be of the IsoSigClassic type (i.e., it
         *   might not match the output from the default version of isoSig()).
         *   If there are any additional arguments supplied in the list \a args,
         *   then these will be passed as subsequent arguments to \a action.
         *
         * - The triangulation argument will be passed as an rvalue; a typical
         *   action could (for example) take it by const reference and query it,
         *   or take it by value and modify it, or take it by rvalue reference
         *   and move it into more permanent storage.
         *
         * - \a action must return a boolean.  If \a action ever returns
         *   \c true, then this indicates that processing should stop
         *   immediately (i.e., no more triangulations will be processed).
         *

         *   from the original form of this triangulation, before any
         *   subsequent changes (if any) were made.
         *
         * - \a action will only be called once for each triangulation
         *   (including this starting triangulation).  In other words, no
         *   triangulation will be revisited a second time in a single call
         *   to retriangulate().
