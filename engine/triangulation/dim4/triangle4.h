 * responsible for their memory management; this is all taken care of by

         * normal hypersurface, then then link is called _thin_.  Otherwise

         * cases could even reduce it to the empty hypersurface.
         *
         * Although normalisation of arbitrary embedded 3-manifolds is messy,
         * for triangle links the process is thankfully simpler.  Essentially,
         * any changes will be limited to operations analagous to compressions
         * and boundary compressions along discs and 3-balls, as well as
         * removing trivial 4-sphere components.
