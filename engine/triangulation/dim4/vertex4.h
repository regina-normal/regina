         * Returns a full 3-manifold triangulation describing

         *
         * This routine is fast (it uses a pre-computed triangulation).
         * The downside is that the triangulation is read-only (though
         * you can always clone it).
         *
         * Regarding the labelling of tetrahedra in the vertex link:
         *
         * - The tetrahedra of the vertex link are numbered as follows.
         *   Let \a i lie between 0 and degree()-1 inclusive, let
         *   \a pent represent `embedding(i).pentachoron()`,
         *   and let \a v represent `embedding(i).vertex()`.
         *   Then `buildLink()->tetrahedron(i)` is the tetrahedron
         *   in the vertex link that "slices off" vertex \a v from
         *   pentachoron \a pent.  In other words,
         *   `buildLink()->tetrahedron(i)` in the vertex link
         *   is parallel to tetrahedron `pent->tetrahedron(v)` in the
         *   surrounding 4-manifold triangulation.
         *
         * - The vertices of each tetrahedron in the vertex link are
         *   numbered as follows.  Following the discussion above,
         *   suppose that `buildLink()->tetrahedron(i)`
         *   sits within \c pent and is parallel to
         *   `pent->tetrahedron(v)`.
         *   Then vertices 0,1,2,3 of the tetrahedron in the link will be
         *   parallel to vertices 0,1,2,3 of the corresponding Tetrahedron<4>.
         *   The permutation `pent->tetrahedronMapping(v)` will map
         *   vertices 0,1,2,3 of the tetrahedron in the link to the
         *   corresponding vertices of \c pent (those opposite \c v),
         *   and will map 4 to \c v itself.
         *
         * - If you need this labelling data in a format that is easy to
         *   compute with, you can call buildLinkInclusion() to retrieve
         *   this information as an isomorphism.
         *
         * \python Since Python does not distinguish between const and
         * non-const, this routine will return by value (thus making a
         * deep copy of the vertex link.  You are free to modify the
         * triangulation that is returned.

         *
         * The documentation for buildLink() describes in plain English
         * exactly how the vertex link will be triangulated.  This function
         * essentially returns the same information in a machine-readable form.
         *
         * Specifically, this function returns an Isomorphism<4> that describes
         * how the individual tetrahedra of the link sit within the pentachora
         * of the original triangulation.  If \a p is the isomorphism returned,

         * \a pent of the 4-manifold triangulation contains the <i>i</i>th
         * tetrahedron of the link.  Moreover, `p.facetPerm(i)` will
         * indicate exactly where the <i>i</i>th tetrahedron sits within
         * \a pent: it will send 4 to the vertex of \a pent that the
         * tetrahedron links, and it will send 0,1,2,3 to the vertices of
         * \a pent that are parallel to vertices 0,1,2,3 of this tetrahedron.
         *
         * Strictly speaking, this is an abuse of the Isomorphism<4> class
         * (the domain is a triangulation of the wrong dimension, and
         * the map is not 1-to-1 into the range pentachora).  We use
