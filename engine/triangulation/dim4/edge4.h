         * Returns a full 2-manifold triangulation describing
         * the link of this edge.
         *
         * This routine is fast (it uses a pre-computed triangulation
         * where possible).  The downside is that the triangulation is
         * read-only (though you can always clone it).
         *
         * Regarding the labelling of triangles in the edge link:
         *
         * - The triangles of the edge link are numbered as follows.
         *   Let \a i lie between 0 and degree()-1 inclusive, let
         *   \a pent represent `embedding(i).pentachoron()`,
         *   and let \a e represent `embedding(i).edge()`.
         *   Then `buildLink()->triangle(i)` is the triangle
         *   in the edge link that links edge \a e of pentachoron \a pent.
         *   In other words, `buildLink()->triangle(i)` in the edge link
         *   is parallel to triangle `pent->triangle(e)` in the
         *   surrounding 4-manifold triangulation.
         *
         * - The vertices of each triangle in the edge link are
         *   numbered as follows.  Following the discussion above,
         *   suppose that `buildLink()->triangle(i)`
         *   sits within \c pent and is parallel to
         *   `pent->triangle(e)`.
         *   Then vertices 0,1,2 of the triangle in the link will be
         *   parallel to vertices 0,1,2 of the corresponding Triangle<4>.
         *   The permutation `pent->triangleMapping(e)` will map
         *   vertices 0,1,2 of the triangle in the link to the
         *   corresponding vertices of \c pent (those opposite \c e),
         *   and will map 3 and 4 to the vertices of \c e itself.
         *
         * - If you need this labelling data in a format that is easy to
         *   compute with, you can call buildLinkInclusion() to retrieve
         *   this information as an isomorphism.
         *
         * \python Since Python does not distinguish between const and
         * non-const, this routine will return by value (thus making a
         * deep copy of the edge link).  You are free to modify the
         * triangulation that is returned.
         *
         * \return the read-only triangulated link of this edge.

         * which returns a full 2-manifold triangulation of the edge link.
         *
         * The documentation for buildLink() describes in plain English
         * exactly how the edge link will be triangulated.  This function
         * essentially returns the same information in a machine-readable form.
         *
         * Specifically, this function returns an Isomorphism<4> that describes
         * how the individual triangles of the link sit within the pentachora
         * of the original triangulation.  If \a p is the isomorphism returned,
         * then `p.pentImage(i)` will indicate which pentachoron
         * \a pent of the 4-manifold triangulation contains the <i>i</i>th
         * triangle of the link.  Moreover, `p.facetPerm(i)` will
         * indicate exactly where the <i>i</i>th triangle sits within
         * \a pent: (i) it will send 3,4 to the vertices of \a pent that lie
         * on the edge that the triangle links, with 3 and 4 mapping to
         * vertices 0 and 1 respectively of the corresponding Edge<4>;
         * and (ii) it will send 0,1,2 to the vertices of \a pent that
         * are parallel to vertices 0,1,2 of this triangle.
         *
         * Strictly speaking, this is an abuse of the Isomorphism<4> class
         * (the domain is a triangulation of the wrong dimension, and
         * the map is not 1-to-1 into the range pentachora).  We use
