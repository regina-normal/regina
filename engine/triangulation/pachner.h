/*! \page pachner Pachner moves on triangulations
 *
 * A Pachner move on a triangulated \a n-manifold \a N works as follows:
 *
 * - One finds a \a k-face \a F of \a N whose link is combinatorially
 *   isomorphic to the link of a \a k-face in the boundary of triangulated
 *   (\a n+1)-simplex.
 *
 * - One then replaces the star of \a F with the complement of the star of
 *   a \a k-face in the boundary of the (\a n+1)-simplex.  This complement
 *   is the star of an (\a n-\a k)-face.
 *
 * We call the \a k-face the _attaching_ face; this is the input to
 * the Pachner move.  The corresponding (\a n-\a k)-face in the
 * new triangulation is called the _belt_ face (in analogy with surgery).
 *
 * Since the star of a \a k-face in the boundary of an (\a n+1)-simplex has
 * (\a n+1-\a k) top-dimensional simplices, the star of the belt
 * (\a n-\a k)-face has (\a k+1) top-dimensional simplices.
 * The Pachner move therefore swaps (\a n+1-\a k) top-dimensional simplices
 * for (\a k+1).
