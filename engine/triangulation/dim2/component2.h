 * Represents a connected component of a 2-manifold triangulation.

 * This is a specialisation of the generic Component class template; see the
 * generic Component documentation for an overview of how the component
 * classes work.  In Python, you can read this generic documentation by
 * looking at a higher dimension: try `help(Component5)`.
 *
 * This 2-dimensional specialisation contains some extra functionality.
 * In particular, each 2-dimensional component also stores details on
 * lower-dimensional faces (i.e., vertices and edges).
 *
 * Components do not support value semantics: they cannot be copied, swapped,
 * or manually constructed.  Their location in memory defines them, and
 * they are often passed and compared by pointer.  End users are never
 * responsible for their memory management; this is all taken care of by
 * the Triangulation to which they belong.
