/**
 * Represents a triangle within a 2-manifold triangulation.
 *
 * This class is typically referred to by the aliases Simplex<2> or
 * Triangle<2> (or, for Python users, \c Simplex2 and \c Triangle2).
 *
 * The class template Face<dim, dim> specialises the generic Face class
 * template in order to work with top-dimensional simplices in a triangulation.
 * This class Face<2, 2> specialises it further to add dimension-specific
 * aliases for dimension 2.
 *
 * See the generic documentation for Face<dim, dim> for an overview of how the
 * top-dimensional simplex classes work.  In Python, you can read this
 * generic documentation by looking at a higher dimension: try `help(Simplex5)`.
 *
 * Triangles do not support value semantics: they cannot be copied, swapped,
 * or manually constructed.  Their location in memory defines them, and
 * they are often passed and compared by pointer.  End users are never
 * responsible for their memory management; this is all taken care of by
 * the Triangulation to which they belong.
