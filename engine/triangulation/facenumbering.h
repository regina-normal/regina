/**
 * Specifies how <i>subdim</i>-faces are numbered within a
 * <i>dim</i>-dimensional simplex.
 *
 * Regina uses the following general scheme for numbering faces:
 *
 * - For low-dimensional faces (\a subdim &lt; \a dim / 2), faces are
 *   numbered in lexicographical order according to their vertices.
 *   For example, in a 3-dimensional triangulation, edges 0,...,5 contain
 *   vertices 01, 02, 03, 12, 13, 23 respectively.
 *
 * - For high-dimensional faces (\a subdim &ge; \a dim / 2), faces are
 *   numbered in \e reverse lexicographical order according to their vertices.
 *   For example, in a 3-dimensional triangulation, triangles 0,...,3 contain
 *   vertices 123, 023, 013, 012 respectively.
 *
 * - As a consequence, unless \a subdim = (<i>dim</i>-1)/2, we always have
 *   <i>subdim</i>-face number \a i opposite (<i>dim</i>-1-<i>subdim</i>)-face
 *   number \a i.  For the special "halfway case" \a subdim = (<i>dim</i>-1)/2,
 *   where each <i>subdim</i>-face is opposite another <i>subdim</i>-face,
 *   we always have <i>subdim</i>-face number \a i opposite
 *   <i>subdim</i>-face number (<i>nFaces</i>-1-\a i).
 *
 * Every class Face<dim, subdim> inherits from this class, which means
 * you can access these routines as Face<dim, subdim>::ordering(),
 * Face<dim, subdim>::faceNumber(), and so on.
 *
 * An advantage of referring to FaceNumbering<dim, subdim> directly (as
 * opposed to Face<dim, subdim>) is that its header is lightweight: it does not
 * pull in the large and complex headers required by Face<dim, subdim>.
 *
 * This class is specialised (and optimised) in Regina's
 * \ref stddim "standard dimensions".
 *
 * \ifacespython This class is not available in Python.  However, all of
 * its routines can be accessed through Face<dim, subdim> (which in Python
 * becomes Face<i>dim</i>_<i>subdim</i>, or one of the type aliases such as
 * Vertex3, Edge2 and so on).
 *
 * \tparam dim the dimension of the simplex whose faces we are numbering.
 * This must be between 1 and 15 inclusive.
 * \tparam subdim the dimension of the faces that we are numbering.
 * This must be between 0 and <i>dim</i>-1 inclusive.

 * joining vertices \a i and \a j in a <i>dim</i>-dimensional simplex.
 *
 * This function is offered because its implementation is faster than
 * working through the FaceNumbering class.
 *
 * The arguments \a i and \a j do not need to appear in ascending order.
 *
 * @param i the first vertex of an edge in a <i>dim</i>-dimensional simplex.
 * This must be between 0 and \a dim inclusive.
 * @param j the second vertex of an edge in a <i>dim</i>-dimensional simplex.
