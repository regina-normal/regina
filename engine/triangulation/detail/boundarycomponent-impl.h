/*! \file triangulation/detail/boundarycomponent-impl.h
 *  \brief Contains some of the implementation details for the generic
 *  BoundaryComponent class template.
 *
 *  This file is \e not included from boundarycomponent.h, and it is not
 *  shipped with Regina's development headers.  The routines it contains are
 *  explicitly instantiated in Regina's calculation engine for all dimensions.
 *
 *  The reason for "quarantining" this file is that the routines it defines
 *  require a definition of the lower-dimensional class Triangulation<dim-1>.
 *  By keeping their implementations safely out of the main headers, we avoid
 *  having Triangulation<dim> recursively instantiate \e all triangulation
 *  classes Triangulation<dim-1>, Triangulation<dim-2>, ..., Triangulation<2>.
 *  This quarantining also helps us to keep the helper class ReorderIterator
 *  out of the main API.
