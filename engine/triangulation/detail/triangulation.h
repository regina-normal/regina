 * Contains implementation details and common functionality for Regina's
 * dimension-agnostic classes.
 *
 * For most of Regina's dimension-agnostic classes, such as
 * Triangulation<dim>, Simplex<dim> and Face<dim, subdim>, the bulk of
 * the implementation is hidden away in the namespace regina::detail.
 *
 * Regina's main classes acquire their functionality through inheritance.
 * For example, the end-user class regina::Triangulation<dim> inherits
 * most of its functionality from the implementation class
 * regina::detail::TriangulationBase<dim>.
 *
 * Because of this inheritance, there is typically no need for
 * end users to explicitly refer to the namespace regina::detail.
 *
 * Since regina::detail contains implementation details, its
 * classes are subject to change between releases.  Specifically:
 *
 * - All member functions that are inherited and exposed by the end-user
 *   classes in regina (e.g., Triangulation, Simplex, Face and so on) may be
 *   considered part of Regina's official API, and will be supported from
 *   release to release.
 *
 * - In constrast, any methods that are not exposed by the end-user classes
 *   (including the names and inheritance structure of classes within
 *   regina::detail) might change in subsequent releases without notice.

 *
 * See the Triangulation class notes for further information.
 *
 * Note that this class does not derive from Output.  This is to avoid clashes
 * with the output code inherited from Packet.  Specifically:
 *
 * - for those dimensions where Triangulation<dim> derives from Packet, the

 *
 * - for other dimensions, Triangulation<dim> derives from Output directly.

         * created in Regina 6.0.1 or earlier are of the default type
         * IsoSigClassic.
         *
         * An <i>isomorphism signature</i> is a compact representation
         * of a triangulation that uniquely determines the triangulation up to
         * combinatorial isomorphism.  That is, for any fixed signature type
         * \a T, two triangulations of dimension \a dim are combinatorially
         * isomorphic if and only if their isomorphism signatures of
         * type \a T are the same.
         *
         * The length of an isomorphism signature is proportional to
         * <tt>n log n</tt>, where \a n is the number of top-dimenisonal
         * simplices.  The time required to construct it is worst-case
         * <tt>O((dim!) n^2 log^2 n)</tt>.  Whilst this is fine for large
         * triangulations, it becomes very slow for large \e dimensions;
         * the main reason for introducing different signature types is that
         * some alternative types can be much faster to compute in practice.
         *
         * Whilst the format of an isomorphism signature bears some
         * similarity to dehydration strings for 3-manifolds, they are more
         * general: isomorphism signatures can be used with any triangulations,
         * including closed, bounded and/or disconnected triangulations,
         * as well as triangulations with many simplices.  Note also that
         * 3-manifold dehydration strings are not unique up to isomorphism
         * (they depend on the particular labelling of tetrahedra).
         *
         * The routine fromIsoSig() can be used to recover a triangulation
         * from an isomorphism signature (only if the default encoding has
         * been used, but it does not matter which signature type was used).
         * The triangulation recovered might not be identical to the original,
         * but it \e will be combinatorially isomorphic.  If you need the
         * precise relabelling, you can call isoSigDetail() instead.
         *
         * Regina supports several different variants of isomorphism signatures,
         * which are tailored to different computational needs; these are
         * currently determined by the template parameters \a Type and
         * \a Encoding:
         *
         * - The \a Type parameter identifies which signature type is to be
         *   constructed.  Essentially, different signature types use
         *   different rules to determine which labelling of a triangulation
         *   is "canonical".  The default type IsoSigClassic is slow
         *   (it never does better than the worst-case time described above);
         *   its main advantage is that it is consistent with the original
         *   implementation of isomorphism signatures in Regina 4.90.
         *
         * - The \a Encoding parameter controls how Regina encodes a canonical
         *   labelling into a final signature.  The default encoding
         *   IsoSigPrintable returns a std::string consisting entirely of
         *   printable characters in the 7-bit ASCII range.  Importantly, this
         *   default encoding is currently the only encoding from which Regina
         *   can \e reconstruct a triangulation from its isomorphism signature.
         *
         * You may instead pass your own type and/or encoding parameters as
         * template arguments.  Currently this facility is for internal use
         * only, and the requirements for type and encoding parameters may
         * change in future versions of Regina.  At present:
         *
         * - The \a Type parameter should be a class that is constructible
         *   from a componenent reference, and that offers the member functions
         *   simplex(), perm() and next(); see the implementation of
         *   IsoSigClassic for details.
         *
         * - The \a Encoding parameter should be a class that offers a
         *   \a Signature type alias, and static functions emptySig() and
         *   encode().  See the implementation of IsoSigPrintable for details.
         *
         * For a full and precise description of the classic isomorphism
         * signature format for 3-manifold triangulations, see
         * <i>Simplification paths in the Pachner graphs of closed orientable
         * 3-manifold triangulations</i>, Burton, 2011,
         * <tt>arXiv:1110.6080</tt>.  The format for other dimensions is
         * essentially the same, but with minor dimension-specific adjustments.
         *
         * \ifacespython Although this is a templated function, all of the
         * variants supplied with Regina are available to Python users.
         * For the default type and encoding, you can simply call isoSig().
         * For other signature types, you should call the function as
