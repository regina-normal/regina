 *
 * Regina's main classes acquire their functionality through inheritance.
 * For example, the end-user class regina::Triangulation<dim> inherits
 * most of its functionality from the implementation class
 * regina::detail::TriangulationBase<dim>.
 *
 * Because of this inheritance, there is typically no need for
 * end users to explicitly refer to the namespace regina::detail.
 *
 * Since regina::detail contains implementation details, its
 * classes are subject to change between releases.  Specifically:
 *
 * - All member functions that are inherited and exposed by the end-user
 *   classes in regina (e.g., Triangulation, Simplex, Face and so on) may be
 *   considered part of Regina's official API, and will be supported from
 *   release to release.
 *
 * - In constrast, any methods that are not exposed by the end-user classes
 *   (including the names and inheritance structure of classes within
 *   regina::detail) might change in subsequent releases without notice.

         * An <i>isomorphism signature</i> is a compact text representation of
         * a triangulation that uniquely determines the triangulation up to
         * combinatorial isomorphism.  That is, two triangulations of
         * dimension \a dim are combinatorially isomorphic if and only if
         * their isomorphism signatures are the same.
         *
         * The isomorphism signature is constructed entirely of printable
         * characters, and has length proportional to <tt>n log n</tt>,
         * where \a n is the number of top-dimenisonal simplices.
         *
         * Whilst the format of an isomorphism signature bears some
         * similarity to dehydration strings for 3-manifolds, they are more
         * general: isomorphism signatures can be used with any triangulations,
         * including closed, bounded and/or disconnected triangulations,
         * as well as triangulations with many simplices.  Note also that
         * 3-manifold dehydration strings are not unique up to isomorphism
         * (they depend on the particular labelling of tetrahedra).
         *
         * The time required to construct the isomorphism signature of a
         * triangulation is <tt>O((dim!) n^2 log^2 n)</tt>.  Whilst this
         * is fine for large triangulation, it will be extremly slow for

         * between this triangulation and the reconstruction from fromIsoSig().
