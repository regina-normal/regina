/**
 * A component of the boundary of a <i>dim</i>-manifold triangulation.
 *
 * Regina recognises three types of boundary components:
 *
 * - A <i>real boundary component</i> is formed from unglued facets
 *   of top-dimensional simplices of the triangulation.  For example,
 *   a real boundary component of a 3-manifold triangulation is formed
 *   from boundary triangles in the 2-skeleton.
 *
 * - An <i>ideal boundary component</i> consists of a single ideal vertex;
 *   that is, a vertex whose link is a closed (<i>dim</i>-1)-manifold but not
 *   a sphere.  This is only possible for dimensions \a dim &ge; 3.
 *
 * - An <i>invalid vertex boundary component</i> consists of a single invalid
 *   invalid vertex that does not belong to a real boundary component.  This
 *   means the vertex link must be an ideal (<i>dim</i>-1)-manifold, or an
 *   invalid (<i>dim</i>-1)-manifold with no real boundary.  Invalid vertex
 *   boundary components are only possible for dimensions \a dim &ge; 4.
 *
 * Ideal and invalid vertex boundary components are \e only recognised
 * when \a dim is one of Regina's \ref stddim "standard dimensions".
 * This is because, in higher dimensions, the relevant conditions rely
 * on undecidable problems.
 *
 * Regina stores different skeletal information for different types of
 * boundary components:
 *
 * - For real boundary components in \ref stddim "standard dimensions",
 *   Regina stores all boundary faces of all dimensions 0,1,...,<i>dim</i>-1.
 *
 * - For real boundary components in higher (non-standard) dimensions,
 *   Regina only stores the boundary (<i>dim</i>-1)-faces (i.e., the unglued
 *   facets of top-dimensional simplices that make up the boundary component).
 *   This is simply to avoid excessive memory usage.
 *
 * - For ideal and invalid vertex boundary components, Regina stores the
 *   relevant vertex.  Such boundary components do not contain any faces
 *   of any dimension greater than zero.
 *
 * We can encounter some interesting cases with invalid triangulations.
 * Consider some face whose link has more than one boundary component
 * (which makes the face invalid).  This means that different parts of the
 * (<i>dim</i>)-manifold boundary are effectively "pinched" together.
 * If this happens, the different parts of the boundary that are pinched
 * might or might not be listed as part of the same boundary component;
 * if not then the offending face will be included in \e all of these
 * boundary components.  Nevertheless, only one of these can be considered
 * the "official" boundary component of the face as returned by
 * Face::boundaryComponent().  This is all a bit of a mess, but then again the
 * entire triangulation is invalid and so you almost certainly have
 * bigger problems to deal with.
 *
 * Boundary components are highly temporary: whenever a triangulation changes,
 * all of its boundary component objects will be deleted and new ones will be
 * created in their place.
 *
 * Boundary components do not support value semantics: they cannot be copied,
 * swapped, or manually constructed.  Their location in memory defines them,
 * and they are often passed and compared by pointer.  End users are never
 * responsible for their memory management; this is all taken care of by
 * the Triangulation to which they belong.
 *
 * \ifacespython Python does not support templates.  Instead
 * this class can be used by appending the dimension as a suffix
 * (e.g., BoundaryComponent2 and BoundaryComponent3 for dimensions 2 and 3).
 *
 * \tparam dim the dimension of the underlying triangulation.
 * This must be between 2 and 15 inclusive.
