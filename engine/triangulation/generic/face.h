/**
 * Represents a <i>subdim</i>-face in the skeleton of a <i>dim</i>-dimensional
 * triangulation.  There are two substantially different cases:
 *
 * - The case \a subdim \< \a dim represents a lower-dimensional face
 *   in a triangulation.  This is implemented by the generic class
 *   template (as documented here), and is specialised for Regina's
 *   \ref stddim "standard dimensions" (as discussed below).
 *
 * - The case \a subdim = \a dim represents a top-dimensional simplex in
 *   a triangulation.  This class has a very different interface, and is
 *   implemented by the partial specialisation Face<dim, dim> (and again
 *   specialised further for \ref stddim "standard dimensions").   This
 *   case is typically referred to using the type alias Simplex<dim>, to
 *   make the distinction clear.  See the documentation for the specialisation
 *   Face<dim, dim> for details on the interface that it provides.
 *
 * For small-dimensional faces, this class is typically described using
 * dimension-specific type aliases: Vertex<dim>, Edge<dim>, Triangle<dim>,
 * Tetrahedron<dim> and Pentachoron<dim> refer to the cases
 * \a subdim = 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.
 *
 * A given <i>subdim</i>-face \a F of the triangulation may appear many
 * times within the various top-dimensional simplices of the underlying
 * triangulation.  As an extreme example, in a 1-vertex triangulation of
 * a 3-manifold, the single vertex makes 4<i>n</i> such appearances,
 * where \a n is the total number of tetrahedra.
 *
 * Each such appearance is described by a single FaceEmbedding object.  You can
 * iterate through these appearances using begin() and end(), or using a
 * range-based \c for loop:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * for (auto& emb : face) { ... }
 * \endcode
 *
 * You can count these appearances by calling degree(), and you can also
 * examine them using routines such as front(), back() and embedding().
 *
 * \warning Face objects are highly temporary: whenever a triangulation
 * changes, all its face objects will be deleted and new ones will be
 * created in their place.
 *
 * For some types of faces in dimensions \a dim = 3 and 4, this template is
 * specialised to offer additional functionality.  In order to use these
 * specialised classes, you will need to include the corresponding triangulation
 * headers (triangulation/dim3.h or triangulation/dim4.h respectively).
 *
 * Faces do not support value semantics: they cannot be copied, swapped,
 * or manually constructed.  Their location in memory defines them, and
 * they are often passed and compared by pointer.  End users are never
 * responsible for their memory management; this is all taken care of by
 * the Triangulation to which they belong.
 *
 * \python Python does not support templates.  Instead
 * this class can be used by appending dimensions \a dim and \a subdim as
 * suffices (e.g., Face2_1 and Face3_0 for the two examples above).
 *
 * \tparam dim the dimension of the underlying triangulation.
 * This must be between 2 and 15 inclusive.
 * \tparam subdim the dimension of the faces that this class represents.
 * This must be between 0 and <i>dim</i> inclusive.
