 * A connected component of a <i>dim</i>-manifold triangulation.

 * Components are highly temporary: whenever a triangulation changes, all
 * of its component objects will be deleted and new ones will be created
 * in their place.
 *
 * For Regina's \ref stddim "standard dimensions", this template is specialised
 * and offers more functionality.  In order to use these specialised classes,
 * you will need to include the corresponding triangulation headers (e.g.,
 * triangulation/dim2.h for \a dim = 2, or triangulation/dim3.h
 * for \a dim = 3).
 *
 * Components do not support value semantics: they cannot be copied, swapped,
 * or manually constructed.  Their location in memory defines them, and
 * they are often passed and compared by pointer.  End users are never
 * responsible for their memory management; this is all taken care of by
 * the Triangulation to which they belong.
 *
 * \ifacespython Python does not support templates.  Instead
 * this class can be used by appending the dimension as a suffix
 * (e.g., Component2 and Component3 for dimensions 2 and 3).
 *
 * \tparam dim the dimension of the underlying triangulation.
 * This must be between 2 and 15 inclusive.
