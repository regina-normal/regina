/**
 * Represents the dual graph of a <i>dim</i>-manifold triangulation; that is,
 * the pairwise matching of facets of <i>dim</i>-dimensional simplices.
 *
 * Given a fixed number of <i>dim</i>-dimensional simplices, each facet of
 * each simplex is either paired with some other simplex facet (which is
 * in turn paired with it) or remains unmatched.  A simplex facet cannot be
 * paired with itself.
 *
 * Such a matching models part of the structure of a <i>dim</i>-manifold
 * triangulation, in which each simplex facet is either glued to some
 * other simplex facet (which is in turn glued to it) or is an unglued
 * boundary facet.  Note however that a facet pairing does not contain
 * enough information to fully reconstruct a triangulation, since
 * the permutations used for each individual gluing are not stored.
 *
 * Facet pairings are \e labelled, in that the simplices are explicitly
 * numbered 0,1,..., and the facets of each simplex are explicitly numbered
 * 0,...,\a dim (just like in a triangulation).  Facet pairings do also come
 * with code to help identify and work with relabellings, via isomorphisms,
 * automorphisms, and canonical representations.  In this context:
 *
 * - An \e isomorphism of a facet pairing means a relabelling of the simplices
 *   and a relabelling of the (\a dim + 1) facets within each simplex;
 *   this can be represented by the same class Isomorphism<dim> that is used
 *   for isomorphisms of triangulations.
 *
 * - An \e automorphism of a facet pairing is an isomorphism that, when
 *   applied, results in an identical facet pairing (i.e., where exactly the
 *   same pairs of labelled simplex facets are matched together).
 *
 * - A facet pairing is in <i>canonical form</i> if it is a
 *   lexicographically minimal representative of its isomorphism class.
 *   Here we order facet pairings by lexicographical comparison of the
 *   sequence <tt>dest(0,0)</tt>, <tt>dest(0,1)</tt>, ...,
 *   <tt>dest(size()-1,\a dim)</tt> (which in turn uses the ordering
 *   defined by FacetSpec<dim>, where each simplex facet is ordered
 *   first by simplex number and then by facet number, and where the
 *   boundary is ordered last).
 *
 * For dimension 3, this FacetPairing class template is specialised and offers
 * more functionality.  In order to use this specialised class, you will need
 * to include the corresponding header triangulation/facetpairing3.h.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.
 *
 * \ifacespython Python does not support templates.  Instead
 * this class can be used by appending the dimension as a suffix
 * (e.g., FacetPairing2 and FacetPairing3 for dimensions 2 and 3).
 *
 * \tparam dim the dimension of the underlying triangulation.
 * This must be between 2 and 15 inclusive.
