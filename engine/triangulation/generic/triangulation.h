namespace regina {

/**
 * A <i>dim</i>-dimensional triangulation, built by gluing together
 * <i>dim</i>-dimensional simplices along their (<i>dim</i>-1)-dimensional
 * facets.  Typically (but not necessarily) such triangulations are used
 * to represent <i>dim</i>-manifolds.
 *
 * Such triangulations are not the same as pure simplicial complexes, for two
 * reasons:
 *
 * - The only identifications that the user can explicitly specify are
 *   gluings between <i>dim</i>-dimensional simplices along their
 *   (<i>dim</i>-1)-dimensional facets.  All other identifications between
 *   <i>k</i>-faces (for any \a k) are simply consequences of these
 *   (<i>dim</i>-1)-dimensional gluings.  In contrast, a simplicial complex
 *   allows explicit gluings between faces of any dimension.
 *
 * - There is no requirement for a <i>k</i>-face to have (<i>k</i>+1) distinct
 *   vertices (so, for example, edges may be loops).  Many distinct
 *   <i>k</i>-faces of a top-dimensional simplex may be identified together
 *   as a consequence of the (<i>dim</i>-1)-dimensional gluings, and indeed
 *   we are even allowed to glue together two distinct factets of the same
 *   <i>dim</i>-simplex.  In contrast, a simplicial complex does not allow
 *   any of these situations.
 *
 * Amongst other things, this definition is general enough to capture
 * any reasonable definition of a <i>dim</i>-manifold triangulation.
 * However, there is no requirement that a triangulation must actually
 * represent a manifold (and indeed, testing this condition is undecidable
 * for sufficiently large \a dim).
 *
 * You can construct a triangulation from scratch using routines such as
 * newSimplex() and Simplex<dim>::join().  There are also routines for
 * exporting and importing triangulations in bulk, such as isoSig() and
 * fromIsoSig() (which use <em>isomorphism signatures</em>), or
 * dumpConstruction() and fromGluings() (which use C++ code).
 *
 * In additional to top-dimensional simplices, this class also tracks:
 *
 * - connected components of the triangulation, as represented by the
 *   class Component<dim>;
 * - boundary components of the triangulation, as represented by the
 *   class BoundaryComponent<dim>;
 * - lower-dimensional faces of the triangulation, as represented by the
 *   classes Face<dim, subdim> for \a subdim = 0,...,(<i>dim</i>-1).
 *
 * Such objects are temporary: whenever the triangulation changes, they will
 * be deleted and rebuilt, and any pointers to them will become invalid.
 * Likewise, if the triangulation is deleted then all component objects
 * will be deleted alongside it.
 *
 * Since Regina 7.0, this is no longer a "packet type" that can be
 * inserted directly into the packet tree.  Instead a Triangulation is now a
 * standalone mathematatical object, which makes it slimmer and faster
 * for ad-hoc use.  The consequences of this are:
 *
 * - If you create your own Triangulation, it will not have any of the usual
 *   packet infrastructure.  You cannot add it into the packet tree, and it will
 *   not support a label, tags, child/parent packets, and/or event listeners.
 *
 * - To include a Triangulation in the packet tree, you must create a new
 *   PacketOf<Triangulation>.  This \e is a packet type, and supports labels,
 *   tags, child/parent packets, and event listeners.  It derives from
 *   Triangulation, and so inherits the full Triangulation interface.
 *
 * - If you are adding new functions to this class that edit the triangulation,
 *   you must still remember to create a ChangeEventSpan.  This will ensure
 *   that, if the triangulation is being managed by a PacketOf<Triangulation>,
 *   then the appropriate packet change events will be fired.  All other events
 *   (aside from packetToBeChanged() and packetWasChanged() are managed
 *   directly by the PacketOf<Triangulation> wrapper class.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.
 *
 * For Regina's \ref stddim "standard dimensions", this template is specialised
 * and offers \e much more functionality.  In order to use these specialised
 * classes, you will need to include the corresponding headers (e.g.,
 * triangulation/dim2.h for \a dim = 2, or triangulation/dim3.h
 * for \a dim = 3).
 *
 * \ifacespython Python does not support templates.  Instead
 * this class can be used by appending the dimension as a suffix
 * (e.g., Triangulation2 and Triangulation3 for dimensions 2 and 3).
 *
 * \tparam dim the dimension of the underlying triangulation.
 * This must be between 2 and 15 inclusive.
