/**
 * Represents a combinatorial isomorphism from one <i>dim</i>-manifold
 * triangulation into another.
 *
 * In essence, a combinatorial isomorphism from triangulation \a T to
 * triangulation \a U is a one-to-one map from the simplices of \a T to the
 * simplices of \a U that allows relabelling of both the simplices and
 * their facets (or equivalently, their vertices), and that preserves
 * gluings across adjacent simplices.
 *
 * More precisely:  An isomorphism consists of (i) a one-to-one map \a f
 * from the simplices of \a T to the simplices of \a U, and (ii) for each
 * simplex \a S of \a T, a permutation \a f<sub>S</sub> of the facets
 * (0,...,\a dim) of \a S, for which the following condition holds:
 *
 *   - If facet \a k of simplex \a S and facet \a k' of simplex \a S'
 *     are identified in \a T, then facet \a f<sub>S</sub>(\a k) of \a f(S)
 *     and facet \a f<sub>S'</sub>(\a k') of \a f(S') are identified in \a U.
 *     Moreover, their gluing is consistent with the facet/vertex permutations;
 *     that is, there is a commutative square involving the gluing maps in
 *     \a T and \a U and the permutations \a f<sub>S</sub> and
 *     \a f<sub>S'</sub>.
 *
 * Isomorphisms can be <i>boundary complete</i> or
 * <i>boundary incomplete</i>.  A boundary complete isomorphism
 * satisfies the additional condition:
 *
 *   - If facet \a x is a boundary facet of \a T then facet \a f(x) is a
 *     boundary facet of \a U.
 *
 * A boundary complete isomorphism thus indicates that a copy of
 * triangulation \a T is present as an entire component (or components) of \a U,
 * whereas a boundary incomplete isomorphism represents an embedding of a
 * copy of triangulation \a T as a subcomplex of some possibly larger component
 * (or components) of \a U.
 *
 * Note that for all types of isomorphism, triangulation \a U is allowed
 * to contain more simplices than triangulation \a T.
 *
 * \ifacespython Python does not support templates.  Instead
 * this class can be used by appending the dimension as a suffix
 * (e.g., Isomorphism2 and Isomorphism3 for dimensions 2 and 3).
 *
 * \tparam dim The dimension of the underlying triangulation.
 * This must be between 2 and 15 inclusive.
