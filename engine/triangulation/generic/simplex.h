/**
 * Represents a top-dimensional simplex in a <i>dim</i>-manifold triangulation.
 *
 * For example, for 3-manifolds this class represents a tetrahedron, and for
 * 2-manifolds this class represents a triangle.
 *
 * Although this is a specialisation of the Face class template, this
 * class is typically referred to using the alias Simplex<dim>.
 * For Regina's \ref stddim "standard dimensions", you can also use the
 * aliases Triangle<2>, Tetrahedron<3> and Pentachoron<4>.
 *
 * Top-dimensional simplices cannot exist in isolation (without a
 * triangulation object), and they cannot be created or destroyed directly.
 * Instead, you create and destroy them via the underlying triangulation,
 * by calling routines such as Triangulation<dim>::newSimplex() or
 * Triangulation<dim>::removeSimplex().
 *
 * Amongst other things, this class is used to view and change the gluings
 * between top-dimensional simplices.  For this we number the facets and
 * vertices of each simplex 0,...,\a dim, so that facet \a i is opposite
 * vertex \a i.
 *
 * Each simplex may have an optional description.  This is typically a
 * human-readable piece of text.  Descriptions are not required, and do
 * not need to be unique.
 *
 * For Regina's \ref stddim "standard dimensions", this template is specialised
 * and offers significant extra functionality.  In order to use these
 * specialised classes, you will need to include the corresponding
 * triangulation headers (e.g., triangulation/dim2.h for \a dim = 2, or
 * triangulation/dim3.h for \a dim = 3).
 *
 * Simplices do not support value semantics: they cannot be copied, swapped,
 * or manually constructed.  Their location in memory defines them, and
 * they are often passed and compared by pointer.  End users are never
 * responsible for their memory management; this is all taken care of by
 * the Triangulation to which they belong.
 *
 * \python Python does not support templates.  Instead
 * this class can be used by appending the dimension as a suffix
 * (e.g., Simplex2 and Simplex3 for dimensions 2 and 3).
 *
 * \tparam dim the dimension of the underlying triangulation.
 * This must be between 2 and 15 inclusive.
 *
