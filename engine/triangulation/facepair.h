 * Represents a pair of tetrahedron face numbers.
 *
 * Note that we are not storing triangle numbers in a triangulation
 * skeleton, but merely face numbers 0, 1, 2 and 3 in a single
 * tetrahedron.  Thus there are only six possible face pairs; this class
 * merely makes working with such pairs more convenient.
 *
 * As well as providing the six possible face pairs, there is also a
 * before-the-start and a past-the-end value; this (combined with the
 * increment operator) allows for iteration through face pairs.
 *
 * When iterating through face pairs, the ordering will be the
 * lexicographical ordering (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).
 *
 * The before-the-start and past-the-end values are internally
 * represented as (0,0) and (3,3) respectively.
 *
 * These objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with std::swap(),
 * with no need for any specialised move operations or swap functions.
