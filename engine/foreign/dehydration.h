/**
 * Reads a list of dehydrated triangulations from the given text file.
 * The file should contain one dehydration string per line.  These strings
 * will be rehydrated as described in Triangulation<3>::rehydrate().
 *
 * A new container will be returned; the imported triangulations will be
 * inserted as children of this container.  The container will not be
 * assigned a label.  The individual triangulations will be assigned labels
 * according to the parameter \a colLabels.
 *
 * If any dehydrations strings are invalid, these will be recorded in an
 * additional text packet that will be the last child of the returned
 * container.
 *
 * If an I/O error occurred while trying to read the given file, 0 will be
 * returned.
 *
 * In its simplest form, the text file can simply contain one
 * dehydration string per line and nothing else.  However, more complex
 * formats are allowed.  In particular, by passing appropriate values
 * for the arguments \a colDehydrations and \a colLabels, the dehydration
 * strings and triangulation packet labels can be taken from arbitrary
 * columns of the text file.  Columns are considered to be separated by
 * whitespace and are numbered beginning at 0.
 *
 * \i18n This routine makes no assumptions about the
 * \ref i18n "character encoding" used in the given file \e name, and
 * simply passes it through unchanged to low-level C/C++ file I/O routines.
 * It assumes however that the \e contents of the file are in UTF-8.
 *
 * @param filename the name of the text file from which to read.
 * @param colDehydrations the column of the text file containing the
 * dehydration strings.
 * @param colLabels the column of the text file containing the
 * triangulation packet labels.  If this is negative then the dehydration
 * strings themselves will be used as packet labels.
 * @param ignoreLines the number of lines at the beginning of the text
 * file that should be ignored completely.
 * @return a new container as described above, or \c null if an I/O error
 * occurred whilst reading the given file.
