/**
 * Reads a list of isomorphism signatures or knot signatures from the given
 * text file.  The file should contain one signature per line.
 * Signatures for knots or triangulations of any dimension are all accepted,
 * though the type of object must be known in advance and fixed for the
 * entire function call using the template parameter \a ObjectType.
 * These signatures will be converted into knots and/or triangulations using
 * Link::fromKnotSig() and Triangulation<dim>::fromIsoSig() respectively.
 *
 * A new container will be returned; the imported knots or triangulations will
 * be inserted as children of this container.  The container will not be
 * assigned a label.  The individual knots or triangulations will be assigned
 * labels according to the parameter \a colLabels.
 *
 * If any signatures are invalid, these will be recorded in an additional
 * text packet that will be the last child of the returned container.
 *
 * If an I/O error occurred while trying to read the given file, \c null will be
 * returned.
 *
 * In its simplest form, the text file can simply contain one
 * signature per line and nothing else.  However, more complex
 * formats are allowed.  In particular, by passing appropriate values
 * for the arguments \a colSigs and \a colLabels, the signatures
 * and packet labels can be taken from arbitrary
 * columns of the text file.  Columns are considered to be separated by
 * whitespace and are numbered beginning at 0.
 *
 * \i18n This routine makes no assumptions about the
 * \ref i18n "character encoding" used in the given file \e name, and
 * simply passes it through unchanged to low-level C/C++ file I/O routines.
 * It assumes however that the \e contents of the file are in UTF-8.
 *
 * \tparam ObjectType Indicates which types of signatures the file contains.
 * This must be either Link (indicating that the file contains knot signatures),
 * or one of the Triangulation<dim> classes (indicating that the file contains
 * isomorphism signatures for <i>dim</i>-dimensional triangulations).
 *
 * \ifacespython Since Python does not support templates, the Python
 * version of this function takes an extra first parameter \a dimension.
 * This should be the dimension of the underlying triangulation type, or 0 to
 * indicate that we are working with knot signatures.  Moreover, the Python
 * version currently only supports Regina's standard dimensions (i.e., you
 * cannot use the Python version of this function with triangulations of
 * dimension 5 or higher).
 *
 * @param filename the name of the text file from which to read.
 * @param colSigs the column of the text file containing the signatures.
 * @param colLabels the column of the text file containing the packet labels
 * for the resulting knots or triangulations.  If this is negative then the
 * signatures themselves will be used as packet labels.
 * @param ignoreLines the number of lines at the beginning of the text
 * file that should be ignored completely.
 * @return a new container as described above, or \c null if an I/O error
 * occurred whilst reading the given file.
