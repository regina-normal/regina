/**
 * Offers direct access to the SnapPea kernel from within Regina.
 * An object of this class represents a 3-manifold triangulation, stored
 * directly in the SnapPea kernel using SnapPea's internal format.
 *
 * Regarding interaction with the SnapPea kernel:
 *
 * - This class acts as the **sole C/C++ conduit** between the Regina
 *   calculation engine and Regina's inbuilt version of the SnapPea kernel.
 *   Regina should not interact with the SnapPea kernel at the C/C++ level
 *   other than through this class.
 *
 * - Regina can, however, interact with SnapPy at the Python level.
 *   Regina's version of the SnapPea kernel lives within a separate namespace
 *   (regina::snappea), and so there should be no conflicts between Regina's
 *   copy and SnapPy's copy of the SnapPea kernel (which may even be different
 *   versions).  You can pass triangulations back and forth between Regina and
 *   SnapPy using strings that contain the contents of a SnapPea data file
 *   (see for instance SnapPeaTriangulation::snapPea()).
 *
 * Regarding the inherited Triangulation<3> interface:
 *
 * - You can happily query this object using both SnapPea functions (such as
 *   SnapPeaTriangulation::volume(), and others specific to this class)
 *   and Regina's native triangulation functions (such as
 *   Triangulation<3>::homology(), and others inherited from Triangulation<3>).
 *   This is because an object of this class stores _two_ representations of
 *   the triangulation (SnapPea's and Regina's), which are always kept in sync.
 *
 * - However, you may **only edit this object using the SnapPea functions
 *   specific to this class** (such as SnapPeaTriangulation::randomise()).
 *   This is essentially because the synchronisation is one-way only (from
 *   SnapPea to Regina, but not in the other direction).
 *
 * - Any attempt to edit this triangulation via the inherited Triangulation<3>
 *   interface (for instance, by calling Triangulation<3>::pachner()) will
 *   automatically cause this to become a **null triangulation**,
 *   with no tetrahedra and no SnapPea data at all.
 *
 * - In particular, if you wish to assign one SnapPea triangulation to another,
 *   or swap the contents of two SnapPea triangulations, then you _must_
 *   cast both objects to SnapPeaTriangulation before performing the operation.
 *   If either argument is presented as the parent class Triangulation<3> then
 *   the inherited operation on Triangulation<3> will be called instead, which
 *   will (as above) nullify one or both SnapPea triangulations respectively.
 *
 * - You cannot use simplex and/or facet locks.  In particular, you must not
 *   call Tetrahedron<3>::lock(), Tetrahedron<3>::lockFacet(), or
 *   Triangle<3>::lock() on a SnapPea triangulation.  Any attempt to do so is
 *   likely to cause exceptions to be thrown in unexpected places.
 *
 * Null triangulations appear more generally when Regina is unable to
 * represent data in SnapPea's native format.  You can test for a
 * null triangulation by calling isNull().  Null triangulations can occur
 * for several reasons, such as (but not limited to):
 *
 * - attempting to build a SnapPea triangulation from a Regina triangulation
 *   that is invalid, has boundary faces, or has higher genus vertex
 *   links (none of which SnapPea can handle);
 *
 * - attempting to read a broken SnapPea data file;
 *
 * - attempting to change a SnapPea triangulation using the inherited
 *   Triangulation<3> interface (as discussed above);
 *
 * - attempting to import a SnapPea triangulation that uses unsupported
 *   (e.g., non-integer or non-coprime) filling coefficients, as discussed
 *   below).
 *
 * Regarding fillings:  SnapPea can store and manipulate Dehn fillings on
 * cusps, and the SnapPeaTriangulation class respects these where it can (but
 * with restrictions on the possible filling coefficients; see below).
 * However, Regina's own Triangulation<3> class knows nothing about fillings
 * at all.  Therefore:
 *
 * - Routines inherited through the Triangulation<3> interface will ignore
 *   fillings completely (so, for instance, homology() will return the
 *   first homology of the unfilled manifold, even if SnapPea has
 *   designated fillings on the cusps).
 *
 * - Routines that are defined here in the SnapPeaTriangulation class
 *   are generally aware of fillings (so, for instance, homologyFilled()
 *   will return the first homology of the filled manifold).  See the
 *   individual notes for each member function for details on how it
 *   handles fillings.
 *
 * - In particular, if you are testing two triangulations for equality:
 *   if either triangulation is presented as the parent class Triangulation<3>
 *   then you will be calling the inherited Triangulation<3> comparision
 *   operators, which _only_ compare the tetrahedron labelling and gluings.
 *   If you wish to compare cusps and fillings as well, you must ensure that
 *   both triangulations are cast to SnapPeaTriangulation (in which case the
 *   SnapPeaTriangulation comparison operators will be used).
 *
 * For now, SnapPeaTriangulation only supports the following types of filling
 * coefficients: on orientable cusps the filling coefficients must be
 * coprime integers, and non non-orientable cusps the filling coefficients
 * must be the integers (±1, 0).  Any attempt to import a triangulation from
 * a SnapPea file with filling coefficients outside these requirements will
 * result in a null triangulation (as discussed above).
 *
 * There are many places in the SnapPea kernel where SnapPea throws a fatal
 * error.  These fatal errors are converted into exceptions (in particular,
 * SnapPeaFatalError and SnapPeaMemoryFull), which can be caught and handled
 * politely.  You should assume, unless you have good reason to believe
 * otherwise (e.g., you have read and traced through the SnapPea source code),
 * that any member function of this class that uses the SnapPea kernel could
 * throw either of these exceptions.
 *
 * Regina uses the variant of the SnapPea kernel that is shipped with
 * SnapPy (standard precision), as well as some additional code
 * written explicitly for SnapPy.  The header regina-config.h includes a
 * macro SNAPPY_VERSION that gives the exact version of SnapPy that is
 * bundled into Regina, and you can query this at runtime by calling
 * Regina's function regina::versionSnapPy().
 *
 * Since Regina 7.0, SnapPeaTriangulation is no longer a "packet type" that can
 * be inserted directly into the packet tree.  Instead a SnapPeaTriangulation
 * is now a standalone mathematatical object, which makes it slimmer and faster
 * for ad-hoc use.  The consequences of this are:
 *
 * - If you create your own SnapPeaTriangulation, it will not have any of the
 *   usual packet infrastructure.  You cannot add it into the packet tree, and
 *   it will not support a label, tags, child/parent packets, and/or event
 *   listeners.
 *
 * - To include a SnapPeaTriangulation in the packet tree, you must create a
 *   new PacketOf<SnapPeaTriangulation>.  This _is_ a packet type, and
 *   supports labels, tags, child/parent packets, and event listeners.
 *   It derives from SnapPeaTriangulation, and so inherits the full
 *   SnapPeaTriangulation interface.
 *
 * Regarding the packet interface, there is currently a deficiency when
 * listening for change events on a PacketOf<SnapPeaTriangulation>:
 *
 * - As described above, if you edit the triangulation using the inherited
 *   Triangulation<3> interface, this will nullify the SnapPea triangulation.
 *
 * - As expected, this will fire a pair of change events.  However, the
 *   packetToBeChanged() event will be fired too late: specifically, it will be
 *   fired _after_ the Triangulation<3> change is made but _before_ the
 *   SnapPea triangulation is nullifed.  In particular, it will already be
 *   too late to take a copy of the original SnapPea triangulation.
 *
 * - Since fixing this will require non-trivial re-engineering of the code,
 *   and since users should not be modifying SnapPea triangulations via the
 *   inherited Triangulation<3> interface, this deficiency is being left to
 *   stay for the time being.
 *
 * If you add new functions to this class that edit the triangulation,
 * there are several pieces of bookkeeping to manage: this includes clearing
 * computed properties, firing packet change events if necessary, and
 * resyncing the internal Regina triangulation to match any changes made
 * within the SnapPea kernel.  Typically you would manage these by creating
 * a single SnapPeaChangeSpan on the stack before the changes takes place.
 * Some notes on this:
 *
 * - SnapPeaChangeSpan is a private inner class within SnapPeaTriangulation
 *   (so it is only intended for use within member functions).
 *
 * - SnapPeaChangeSpan _replaces_ the usual ChangeEventSpan (or
 *   ChangeEventGroup) that would commonly be used with other packet types.
 *   You should _not_ create a ChangeEventSpan or ChangeEventGroup as well.
 *
 * - The SnapPeaChangeSpan class takes an optional policy template argument.
 *   Do take care to ensure that you are using the correct policy - for example,
 *   if you are changing the combinatorics of the triangulation then you
 *   probably want the default \c changeTriangulation, but if you are only
 *   changing the fillings on the cusps then \c changeFillingsOnly is
 *   more appropriate.  See the inner ChangePolicy enumeration for details.
 *
 * The SnapPeaTriangulation class implements C++ move semantics and adheres
 * to the C++ Swappable requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies
 * wherever possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.
 *
 * The SnapPea kernel was originally written by Jeff Weeks.  SnapPy,
 * where this kernel is now maintained, is primarily developed by Marc Culler,
 * Nathan Dunfield and Matthias Goerner, with contributions from many people.
 * SnapPy and the corresponding SnapPea kernel are distributed under the terms
 * of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or any later version, as
 * published by the Free Software Foundation.
 *
 * See http://snappy.computop.org/ for further information on
 * SnapPea and its successor SnapPy.
 *
 * \exception SnapPeaFatalError The SnapPea kernel detected a fatal error
 * from which it could not recover.  This could be thrown by any member
 * function that uses the SnapPea kernel.
 *
 * \exception SnapPeaMemoryFull The SnapPea kernel ran out of memory.
 * This could be thrown by any member function that uses the SnapPea kernel.

         * not be affected if \a tri is later changed or destroyed).
         *
         * Since Regina works with more general kinds of
         * trianguations than SnapPea, not all Regina triangulations can be
         * represented in SnapPea format.  If the conversion is
         * unsuccessful, this will be marked as a null triangulation.
         * You should always test isNull() to determine whether the
         * conversion was successful.
         *
         * Regarding the conversion:
         *
         * - If \a tri is of the subclass SnapPeaTriangulation, then
         *   this effectively acts as a copy constructor: all
         *   SnapPea-specific information will be cloned directly
         *   through the SnapPea kernel.  If \a tri is a null SnapPea
         *   triangulation then this copy will be a null triangulation also.
         *
         * - If \a tri is of the parent class Triangulation<3>, then
         *   Regina will attempt to convert this triangulation to
         *   SnapPea format.  If the conversion is successful, this
         *   constructor will immediately ask SnapPea to try to find a
         *   hyperbolic structure.
         *
         * Regarding peripheral curves: native Regina triangulations do not
         * store or use peripheral curves themselves, and so this constructor
         * makes a default choice during the conversion process.  Specifically:
         *
         * - If solution_type() is geometric_solution or nongeometric_solution,
         *   then on each torus cusp the meridian and longitude are chosen to
         *   be the (shortest, second shortest) basis, and their orientations
         *   follow the convention used by the \e SnapPy kernel.  Be warned,
         *   however, that this choice might not be unique for some cusp shapes,
         *   and the resolution of such ambiguities might be machine-dependent.
         *
         * - If solution_type() is something else (e.g., degenerate or flat),
         *   or if SnapPea throws a fatal error when attempting to install the
         *   (shortest, second shortest) basis as described above, then Regina
         *   will accept whatever basis SnapPea installs by default.  Be warned
         *   that this default basis may change (and indeed has changed in the
         *   past) across different versions of the SnapPea kernel.
         *
         * Regarding internal vertices (i.e., vertices whose links are spheres):
         * SnapPea is designed to work only with triangulations where
         * every vertex is ideal.  As a result:
         *
         * - You may pass a closed triangulation to this constructor, but
         *   SnapPea will automatically convert this into a filling of a
         *   cusped manifold, using an ideal triangulation.
         *
         * - You may also pass a triangulation that uses both ideal and
         *   internal vertices.  In this case, SnapPea will retriangulate
         *   the manifold so that it uses ideal vertices only.
         *
         * Even if SnapPea does not retriangulate the manifold (for the
         * reasons described above), it is possible that the tetrahedron and
         * vertex numbers might be changed in the new SnapPea triangulation.
         * In particular, if the given Regina triangulation is orientable but
         * not oriented, then you should _expect_ these numbers to change.
         *
         * \param tri the Regina triangulation to clone.
         * \param ignored a legacy parameter that is now ignored.

         *
         * If you are only interested in the corresponding index \a k subgroups

         * then you may wish to consider the native Regina function
         * GroupPresentation::enumerateCovers() instead.  That function is
         * highly optimised, and should be considerably faster as \a k grows.

         * Each covering space is produced once up to equivalence; here
         * equivalent covers correspond to conjugate representations of

         *
         * To enumerate _all_ <i>k</i>-sheeted covers up to equivalence,

         *   individually for each cover).  You should, however, never see
         *   the value \a unknown_cover.
         *
         * - If there are any additional arguments supplied in the list \a args,
         *   then these will be passed as subsequent arguments to \a action.

         * tasks include: clearing and/or refreshing computed properties;
         * firing packet change events if necessary; and resyncing the
         * inherited Regina triangulation data to match changes made
         * within the SnapPea kernel.
         *
         * Specifically, a member function that modifies a SnapPea triangulation
         * should create a SnapPeaChangeSpan on the stack before the changes
         * take place.  The exact behaviour of this SnapPeaChangeSpan will
         * depend on the template argument \a policy, and you should check
         * that you are using the right policy for your specific change;
         * see the ChangePolicy enumeration for details on the various options.
         *
         * In summary, this SnapPeaChangeSpan will:
         *
         * - temporarily set Triangulation<3>::heldBy_ to HELD_BY_NONE for
         *   the lifetime of the SnapPeaChangeSpan, unless \a policy is
         *   \c changeFillingsOnly (which means the inherited Triangulation<3>
         *   data does not change);
         *
         * - call sync() within the SnapPeaChangeSpan destructor to resync the
         *   inherited Triangulation<3> data to match the data stored in the
         *   SnapPea kernel, but only if \a policy is \c changeTriangulation;
         *
         * - call fillingsHaveChanged() within the SnapPeaChangeSpan destructor
         *   to clear and/or refresh computed properties that depend on the
         *   filling parameters stored in the SnapPea kernel, unless \a policy
         *   is changeTriangulationNoSync;
         *
         * - fire packet change events on construction and destruction,
         *   in the same way that ChangeEventSpan does.
         *
         * Using a local SnapPeaChangeSpan on the stack is preferable to
         * managing all of this bookkeeping manually, since the SnapPea
         * interface is one part of Regina where exceptions can regularly and
         * unexpectedly be thrown, and so this helps ensure that things are
         * always tidied up correctly.
         *
         * Note that SnapPeaChangeSpan _replaces_ the usual ChangeEventSpan
         * (or ChangeEventGroup) that would commonly be used with other packet
         * types.  There is no need to create a separate ChangeEventSpan or
         * ChangeEventGroup in addition to your SnapPeaChangeSpan.
         *
         * Regarding nesting: this class uses a ChangeEventSpan internally,
         * and is therefore able to nest with other ChangeEventSpan objects
         * in the usual way.
