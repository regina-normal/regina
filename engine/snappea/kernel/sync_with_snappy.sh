# Usage: sync_with_snappy <snappy_source_dir>
#
# Synchronises Regina's SnapPea kernel with the given version of SnapPy,
# by copying the relevant files from SnapPy into the correct locations here.
#
# You should always check the diffs carefully to ensure that you are not
# clobbering any of Regina's own patches to the SnapPea kernel.
