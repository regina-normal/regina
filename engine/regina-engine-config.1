.SH SYNOPSIS

[\fB\-\-prefix\fP[=\fIDIR\fP]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIregina-engine-config\fP tells you which compiler and linker flags should
be used to build the mathematical engine of Regina into your own programs.
Regina's mathematical engine is in the library \fIlibregina-engine.so\fP.
.PP
Regina is a software package for 3-manifold and 4-manifold topologists,
with a focus on triangulations, knots and links, normal surfaces, and
angle structures.
.PP
For 3-manifolds, it includes high-level tasks such as 3-sphere recognition,
connected sum decomposition and Hakenness testing, comes with a rich
database of census manifolds, and incorporates the SnapPea kernel for
working with hyperbolic manifolds.  For 4-manifolds, it offers a range of
combinatorial and algebraic tools, plus support for normal hypersurfaces.
For knots and links, Regina can perform combinatorial manipulation,
compute knot polynomials, and work with several import/export formats.
.SH OPTIONS
\fIregina-engine-config\fP accepts the following options.
.TP
\fB\-\-prefix\fP=\fIDIR\fP
Use DIR instead of the installation prefix that Regina
was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags and
\-\-libs options. This option is also used for the exec prefix
if \-\-exec\-prefix is not specified.  This option must be specified
before any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
If no DIR is specified then the current installation prefix will be
written to standard output.

Most people will not need this option.
.TP
\fB\-\-exec\-prefix\fP=\fIDIR\fP
Use DIR instead of the installation exec prefix that
Regina was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags
and \-\-libs options.  This option must be specified before any
\-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
If no DIR is specified then the current installation exec prefix will be
written to standard output.

Most people will not need this option.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the currently installed version of Regina.
.TP
.B \-\-libs
Print the linker flags that are required to link a program against
the Regina calculation engine.
.TP
.B \-\-cflags
Print the compiler flags that are required to compile a program that
uses the Regina calculation engine.
