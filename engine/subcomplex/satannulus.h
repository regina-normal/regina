/**
 * Represents an annulus formed from a pair of triangles in a Seifert fibred
 * space.  This annulus is saturated, i.e., a union of fibres.  More than
 * that, the fibres run parallel to the two boundary edges of the annulus.
 *
 * The annulus is described from one side only.  The description
 * includes an array of indices \a tet[] describing which two tetrahedra
 * provide the triangles of the annulus, as well as an array of permutations
 * \a roles[] detailing how the annulus matches up with the individual
 * tetrahedron vertices.
 *
 * The annulus can be drawn as follows, with the upper edge identified
 * with the lower:
 *
 * <pre>
 *            *--->---*
 *            |0  2 / |
 *    First   |    / 1|  Second
 *   triangle |   /   | triangle
 *            |1 /    |
 *            | / 2  0|
 *            *--->---*
 * </pre>
 *
 * Suppose that \a tet[0] and \a tet[1] are the tetrahedra providing the
 * first and second triangles respectively.  Then the markings 0..2 on the
 * first triangle above correspond to vertices \a roles[0][0..2] of tetrahedron
 * \a tet[0], and likewise the markings 0..2 on the second triangle above
 * correspond to vertices \a roles[1][0..2] of tetrahedron \a tet[1].
 *
 * Note that the diagram above can also be drawn as follows.
 *
 * <pre>
 *            *--->---*
 *            | \ 2  1|
 *    First   |0 \    |  Second
 *   triangle |   \   | triangle
 *            |    \ 0|
 *            |1  2 \ |
 *            *--->---*
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note also that the labelling of the tetrahedra and their vertices
 * establishes an orientation on the vertical fibres, as well as a
 * left-to-right direction across the annulus.
 *
 * For convenience we refer to edges \a roles[][0-1] as \e vertical,
 * edges \a roles[][0-2] as \e horizontal, and edge \a roles[][1-2] as
 * \e diagonal.  This is illustrated in the following diagrams.
 *
 * <pre>
 *         V  Horizontal       V   Diagonal
 *         e  *--->---*        e  *--->---*
 *         r  |   g / |        r  |H\ 2  1|
 *         t  |  a / 1|        t  | o\    |
 *         i  | i /   |        i  |  r\   |
 *         c  |D /    |        c  |   i\ 0|
 *         a  | / 2  0|        a  |    z\ |
 *         l  *--->---*        l  *--->---*
 * </pre>
 *
 * These objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with std::swap(),
 * with no need for any specialised move operations or swap functions.
 *
 * \ifacespython The member arrays \a tet and \a roles are accessed for
 * reading through functions \a tet() and \a roles() respectively.  For
 * instance, the first triangle tetrahedron for the saturated annulus \a a can
 * be accessed as <tt>a.tet(0)</tt>.  These same member arrays are
 * accessed for writing through functions \a setTet() and \a setRoles(),
 * so for instance the second triangle vertex roles for the saturated annulus
 * \a a can be modified by calling <tt>a.setRoles(1, newRoles)</tt>.
