 * Represents a 2-sphere made from two triangles glued together along their
 * three edges.  The two triangles must be distinct and the three edges of
 * each triangle must also be distinct.  Neither of the triangles may be
 * boundary triangles.
 * These two triangless together form an embedded 2-sphere in the triangulation
 * (with the exception that two or three points of the sphere corresponding
 * to the triangles vertices may be identified).
 *
 * This 2-sphere can be cut along and the two resulting 2-sphere
 * boundaries filled in with 3-balls, and the resulting triangulation has
 * the same number of tetrahedra as the original.  If the original
 * 2-sphere was separating, the resulting triangulation will contain the
 * two terms of the corresponding connected sum.
 *
 * These objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with std::swap(),
 * with no need for any specialised move operations or swap functions.
 * However, the only way to create them (aside from copying or moving)
 * is via the static member function recognise().
