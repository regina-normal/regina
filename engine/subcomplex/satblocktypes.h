/**
 * A degenerate zero-tetrahedron saturated block that corresponds to
 * attaching a Mobius band to a single annulus boundary.
 *
 * This is a degenerate case of the layered solid torus (see the class
 * SatLST), where instead of joining a solid torus to an annulus
 * boundary we join a Mobius band.  The Mobius band can be thought of as
 * a zero-tetrahedron solid torus with two boundary triangles, which in fact
 * are opposite sides of the same triangle.  By attaching a zero-tetrahedron
 * Mobius band to an annulus boundary, we are effectively joining the
 * two triangles of the annulus together.
 *
 * The meridinal disc of this zero-tetrahedron solid torus meets the
 * three edges of the annulus in 1, 1 and 2 places, so it is in fact
 * a degenerate (1,1,2) layered solid torus.  Note that the weight 2 edge
 * is the boundary edge of the Mobius strip.
 *
 * This class does not support value semantics: it cannot be copied, swapped
 * or manually constructed.  Its memory is managed by the SatRegion class, and
 * blocks' locations in memory define them.  See SatRegion for further details.

/**
 * A degenerate saturated block that is a single tetrahedron wrapped
 * around so that two opposite edges touch.  This forms a degenerate
 * one-tetrahedron solid torus that is pinched along a single meridinal
 * curve.
 *
 * The four faces of this tetrahedron form two boundary annuli, and the
 * tetrahedron is effectively layered onto each boundary annulus.  See
 * the Layering class notes for more discussion on layerings in general.
 *
 * Although this block is degenerate (the fibres are all pinched
 * together where the opposite edges of the tetrahedron meet), it can be
 * used without problems as long as the entire Seifert fibred space is
 * not formed from degenerate blocks.  In other words, using such blocks
 * is fine as long as they eventually meet a real (non-degenerate) block,
 * which will give room for the fibres to separate so that they are no
 * longer pinched together.
 *
 * The SatAnnulus class notes describe horizontal and diagonal edges of
 * a saturated annulus.  This block may be one of two types, according
 * to how the tetrahedron is layered onto the boundary annuli.  Either
 * the tetrahedron can be layered over the horizontal edge of each
 * annulus (with the fibres pinched together between the two diagonal
 * edges), or the tetrahedron can be layered over the diagonal edge of
 * each annulus (with the fibres pinched together between the two
 * horizontal edges).
 *
 * This class does not support value semantics: it cannot be copied, swapped
 * or manually constructed.  Its memory is managed by the SatRegion class, and
 * blocks' locations in memory define them.  See SatRegion for further details.
