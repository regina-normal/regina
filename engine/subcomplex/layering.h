/**
 * Represents a layering of zero or more tetrahedra upon a torus
 * boundary.
 *
 * A \e layering involves laying a new tetrahedron flat upon two
 * adjacent boundary triangles in order to change the boundary curves.  Many
 * tetrahedra may be layered upon a boundary in succession in order to
 * change the boundary curves more dramatically.
 *
 * A torus boundary is specified by two tetrahedra (which may be the same)
 * and two permutations.  Each permutation maps (0,1,2) in the diagram
 * below to the corresponding vertex numbers in each tetrahedron (and
 * therefore maps 3 to the corresponding face number).
 *
 * <pre>
 *     *--->>--*
 *     |0  2 / |
 *     |    / 1|
 *     v   /   v
 *     |1 /    |
 *     | / 2  0|
 *     *--->>--*
 * </pre>
 *
 * In particular, if the two tetrahedra are \a t0 and \a t1 and the two
 * corresponding permutations are \a p0 and \a p1, then:
 * - the torus boundary is formed from faces \a p0[3] and \a p1[3] of
 *   tetrahedra \a t0 and \a t1 respectively;
 * - edges \a p0[0]-\a p0[1] and \a p1[1]-\a p1[0] of tetrahedra
 *   \a t0 and \a t1 respectively are identified;
 * - edges \a p0[1]-\a p0[2] and \a p1[2]-\a p1[1] of tetrahedra
 *   \a t0 and \a t1 respectively are identified;
 * - edges \a p0[2]-\a p0[0] and \a p1[0]-\a p1[2] of tetrahedra
 *   \a t0 and \a t1 respectively are identified.
 *
 * Note that we do not actually require these triangular faces to form a torus,
 * and this is never verifed by any of the routines in this class.  What
 * these routines do is use the diagram above to define the rules of
 * what forms a valid layering (and in fact the layering itself will
 * often be the cause of these edge identifications).  This allows the
 * Layering class a little more versatility in degenerate and boundary cases.
 *
 * This class keeps track of an \e old boundary, which is the original
 * pair of triangles upon which the first tetrahedron is layered, and a
 * \e new boundary, which is formed by the last layered tetrahedron and
 * contains the modified boundary curves.  If no tetrahedra are layered
 * at all then the old and new boundaries will be identical.
 *
 * This class is used to search for layerings as follows.  The
 * constructor is called with a particular pair of triangles that will form
 * the old boundary (note that these are generally \e not boundary triangles
 * in the triangulation, since we are searching for layerings that have
 * been placed upon them).  This forms a trivial (zero-tetrahedron)
 * layering.  The routines extend() or extendOne() are then called to see
 * how many additional tetrahedra have been layered upon this pair of triangles
 * according to the rules above.
 *
 * These objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with std::swap(),
 * with no need for any specialised move operations or swap functions.
