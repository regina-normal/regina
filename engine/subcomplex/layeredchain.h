/**
 * Represents a layered chain in a triangulation.
 *
 * A layered chain is a set of \a n tetrahedra glued to each other by
 * layerings.  For each tetrahedron, select two top faces, two bottom
 * faces and two hinge edges, so that the top faces are adjacent, the
 * bottom faces are adjacent, the hinge edges are opposite and each
 * hinge meets both a top and a bottom face.  The tetrahedron can thus
 * be thought of as a fattened square with the top and bottom faces
 * above and below the square respectively, and the hinges as the top
 * and bottom edges of the square.  The left and right edges of the
 * square are identified to form an annulus.
 *
 * For each \a i, the top faces of tetrahedron \a i are glued to the
 * bottom faces of tetrahedron <i>i</i>+1.  This is done by layering the
 * upper tetrahedron upon the annulus formed by the top faces of the
 * lower tetrahedron.  The layering should be done over the left or
 * right edge of the lower square (note that these two edges are
 * actually identified).  The top hinges of each tetrahedron should be
 * identified, as should the bottom hinges.
 *
 * The bottom faces of the first tetrahedron and the top faces of the
 * last tetrahedron form the boundary of the layered chain.  If there is
 * more than one tetrahedron, the layered chain forms a solid torus with
 * two vertices whose axis is parallel to each hinge edge.
 *
 * The \a index of the layered chain is the number of tetrahedra it
 * contains.  A layered chain must contain at least one tetrahedron.
 *
 * Note that for the purposes of manifold() and homology(), a
 * layered chain containing only one tetrahedron will be considered as a
 * standalone tetrahedron that forms a 3-ball (and not a solid torus).
 *
 * All optional StandardTriangulation routines are implemented for this class.
 *
 * This class supports copying but does not implement separate move operations,
 * since its internal data is so small that copying is just as efficient.
 * It implements the C++ Swappable requirement via its own member and global
 * swap() functions, for consistency with the other StandardTriangulation
 * subclasses.
