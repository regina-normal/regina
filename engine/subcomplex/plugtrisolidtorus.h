/**
 * Represents a plugged triangular solid torus component of a
 * triangulation.  Such a component is obtained as follows.
 *
 * Begin with a three-tetrahedron triangular solid torus (as described by
 * class TriSolidTorus).  Observe that the three axis edges divide the
 * boundary into three annuli.
 *
 * To each of these annuli a layered chain may be optionally attached.
 * If present, the chain should be attached so its hinge edges are
 * identified with the axis edges of the corresonding annulus and its bottom
 * tetrahedron is layered over either the major edge or minor edge of the
 * corresponding annulus.  The top two triangular faces of the layered chain
 * should remain free.
 *
 * Thus we now have three annuli on the boundary, each represented as a
 * square two of whose (opposite) edges are axis edges of the original
 * triangular solid torus (and possibly also hinge edges of a layered
 * chain).
 *
 * Create a \e plug by gluing two tetrahedra together along a single
 * triangle.  The six edges that do not run along this common triangle split the
 * plug boundary into three squares.  These three squares must be glued
 * to the three boundary annuli previously described.  Each axis edge meets
 * two of the annuli; the two corresponding edges of the plug must be
 * non-adjacent (have no common vertex) on the plug.
 * In this way each of the six edges of the plug not running along its
 * interior triangle corresponds to precisely one of the two instances of
 * precisely one of the three axis edges.
 *
 * If the axis edges are directed so that they all point the
 * same way around the triangular solid torus, these axis edges when
 * drawn on the plug must all point from one common tip of the plug to
 * the other (where the \e tips of the plug are the vertices not meeting the
 * interior triangle).  The gluings must also be made so that the resulting
 * triangulation component is orientable.
 *
 * Of the optional StandardTriangulation routines, manifold() is
 * implemented for most plugged triangular solid tori and
 * homology() is not implemented at all.
 *
 * This class supports copying but does not implement separate move operations,
 * since its internal data is so small that copying is just as efficient.
 * It implements the C++ Swappable requirement via its own member and global
 * swap() functions, for consistency with the other StandardTriangulation
 * subclasses.  Note that the only way to create these objects (aside from
 * copying or moving) is via the static member function recognise().
