/**
 * Describes a layered torus bundle.  This is a triangulation of a
 * torus bundle over the circle formed as follows.
 *
 * We begin with a thin I-bundle over the torus, i.e,. a triangulation
 * of the product <tt>T x I</tt> that is only one tetrahedron thick.
 * This is referred to as the \a core, and is described by an object
 * of type TxICore.
 *
 * We then identify the upper and lower torus boundaries of this core
 * according to some homeomorphism of the torus.  This may be impossible
 * due to incompatible boundary edges, and so we allow a layering of
 * tetrahedra over one of the boundari tori in order to adjust the
 * boundary edges accordingly.  Layerings are described in more detail
 * in the Layering class.
 *
 * Given the parameters of the core <tt>T x I</tt> and the specific layering,
 * the monodromy for this torus bundle over the circle can be calculated.
 * The manifold() routine returns details of the corresponding 3-manifold.
 *
 * All optional StandardTriangulation routines are implemented for this class.
 *
 * This class supports copying but does not implement separate move operations,
 * since its internal data is so small that copying is just as efficient.
 * It implements the C++ Swappable requirement via its own member and global
 * swap() functions, for consistency with the other StandardTriangulation
 * subclasses.  Note that the only way to create these objects (aside from
 * copying or moving) is via the static member function recognise().

         *
         * The TxICore class documentation describes generating \a alpha

         * <tt>T x I</tt> (which are referred to as the \e upper and
         * \e lower boundaries).  The two boundary tori are parallel in
         * two directions: through the core, and through the layering.
         * It is desirable to know the parallel relationship between
         * the two sets of boundary curves in each direction.
         *
         * The relationship through the core is already described by
         * TxICore::parallelReln().  This routine describes the
         * relationship through the layering.
         *
         * Let \a a_u and \a b_u be the \a alpha and \a beta curves on
         * the upper boundary torus, and let \a a_l and \a b_l be the
         * \a alpha and \a beta curves on the lower boundary torus.
         * Suppose that the upper \a alpha is parallel to
         * \a w.\a a_l + \a x.\a b_l, and that the upper \a beta is
         * parallel to \a y.\a a_l + \a z.\a b_l.  Then the matrix
         * returned will be
         *
         * <pre>
         *     [ w  x ]
         *     [      ] .

         *     [ a_u ]                      [ a_l ]

         * </pre>
         *
         * It can be observed that this matrix expresses the upper
         * boundary curves in terms of the lower, whereas
         * TxICore::parallelReln() expresses the lower boundary curves
         * in terms of the upper.  This means that the monodromy
         * describing the overall torus bundle over the circle can be
         * calculated as
         * <pre>
         *     M  =  layeringReln() * core().parallelReln()
         * </pre>

         * <pre>
         *     M'  =  core().parallelReln() * layeringReln() .
         * </pre>
         *
         * Note that in the degenerate case where there is no layering at
         * all, this matrix is still perfectly well defined; in this
         * case it describes a direct identification between the upper
