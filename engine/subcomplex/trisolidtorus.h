/**
 * Represents a three-tetrahedron triangular solid torus in a triangulation.
 * A three-tetrahedron triangular solid torus is a three-tetrahedron
 * triangular prism with its two ends identified.
 *
 * The resulting triangular solid torus will have all edges as boundary
 * edges.  Three of these will be <i>axis edges</i> (parallel to the
 * axis of the solid torus).  Between the axis edges will be three
 * annuli, each with two internal edges.  One of these internal edges will
 * meet all three tetrahedra (the \a major edge) and one of these internal
 * edges will only meet two of the tetrahedra (the \a minor edge).
 *
 * Assume the axis of the layered solid torus is oriented.  The three
 * major edges together form a loop on the boundary torus.  This loop can
 * be oriented to run around the solid torus in the same direction as
 * the axis; this then induces an orientation on the boundary of a
 * meridinal disc.  Thus, using an axis edge as longitude, the three major
 * edges will together form a (1,1) curve on the boundary torus.
 *
 * We can now orient the minor edges so they also run around the solid torus
 * in the same direction as the axis, together forming a
 * (2, -1) curve on the boundary torus.
 *
 * Finally, the three tetrahedra can be numbered 0, 1 and 2 in an order
 * that follows the axis, and the annuli can be numbered 0, 1 and 2 in
 * an order that follows the meridinal disc boundary so that annulus
 * \a i does not use any faces from tetrahedron \a i.
 *
 * Note that all three tetrahedra in the triangular solid torus must be
 * distinct.
 *
 * All optional StandardTriangulation routines are implemented for this class.
 *
 * This class supports copying but does not implement separate move operations,
 * since its internal data is so small that copying is just as efficient.
 * It implements the C++ Swappable requirement via its own member and global
 * swap() functions, for consistency with the other StandardTriangulation
 * subclasses.  Note that the only way to create these objects (aside from
 * copying or moving) is via the static member function recognise().
