/**
 * Represents an augmented triangular solid torus component of a
 * triangulation.  Such a component is obtained as follows.  Begin with
 * a three-tetrahedron triangular solid torus (as described by
 * TriSolidTorus).  Observe that the three axis edges divide the
 * boundary into three annuli.  Then take one of the following actions.
 *
 *   - To each of these annuli, glue a layered solid torus.
 *     Note that the degenerate (2,1,1) layered solid torus
 *     (i.e., a one-triangle mobius strip) is allowed and corresponds to
 *     simply gluing the two triangles of the annulus together.
 *
 *   - To one of these annuli, glue a layered solid torus as described
 *     above.  Join the other two annuli with a layered chain
 *     in either the manner described by
 *     TriSolidTorus::areAnnuliLinkedMajor() or the manner described by
 *     TriSolidTorus::areAnnuliLinkedAxis().
 *
 * It will be assumed that all layered solid tori other than the
 * degenerate (2,1,1) will have (3,2,1) layered solid tori at their
 * bases.  That is, layered solid tori that begin with the degenerate
 * (2,1,1) and layer over the boundary of the mobius strip are \b not
 * considered in this class.
 *
 * Note that (unless a (1,1,0) layered solid torus is used with the 0
 * edge glued to an axis edge) the resulting space will be a Seifert
 * fibred space over the 2-sphere with at most three exceptional fibres.
 *
 * Of the optional StandardTriangulation routines, manifold() is
 * implemented for most augmented triangular solid tori and
 * homology() is not implemented at all.
 *
 * This class supports copying but does not implement separate move operations,
 * since its internal data is so small that copying is just as efficient.
 * It implements the C++ Swappable requirement via its own member and global
 * swap() functions, for consistency with the other StandardTriangulation
 * subclasses.  Note that the only way to create these objects (aside from
 * copying or moving) is via the static member function recognise().
