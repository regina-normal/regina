/**
 * Describes how a single saturated block forms a part of a larger
 * saturated region.
 *
 * A saturated region consists of several saturated blocks joined
 * together along their boundary annuli.  This is a helper class
 * containing a single saturated block along with details of its
 * orientation within a larger region.
 *
 * The ring of saturated annuli around the boundary of the block gives a
 * natural orientation to the block within the context of the base orbifold,
 * just as the ring of edges around a polygon would give a natural
 * orientation to that polygon within the context of a surrounding surface.
 * Again drawing an analogy with the orientation of polygons within a surface,
 * each block can be considered to have a correct or reflected orientation
 * according to whether this ring of annuli runs clockwise or anticlockwise
 * in the base orbifold.
 *
 * The precise orientation of a block is described using two booleans.
 * A block may be reflected _horizontally_, which preserves the
 * directions of Seifert fibres but which reverses the
 * clockwise/anticlockwise orientation as discussed above.  A block may
 * also be reflected _vertically_, which preserves the
 * clockwise/anticlockwise orientation but which reverses the directions
 * of the Seifert fibres.  A block may of course be reflected both
 * horizontally and vertically, or it may not be reflected at all.
 *
 * Since Regina 7.0, this helper structure now owns its internal SatBlock,
 * and will destroy this SatBlock when this structure itself is destroyed.
 * This is a change in behaviour from Regina 6.0.1 and earlier.
 *
 * Because of these new ownership semantics, SatBlockSpec is no longer
 * copyable.  However, it is both movable and swappable (it implements
 * C++ moves semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable requirement).

/**
 * A large saturated region in a Seifert fibred space formed by joining
 * together saturated blocks.
 *
 * Like a saturated block (described in the class SatBlock), a
 * saturated region is a connected set of tetrahedra built from a subset
 * of fibres.  Unlike a saturated block however, a saturated region has
 * no constraints on its boundary - it may have several boundary
 * components or it may have none.  For instance, a saturated region
 * might be an entire closed Seifert fibred space, or it might describe
 * a Seifert fibred component of a JSJ decomposition.
 *
 * A saturated region is formed from a collection of saturated blocks by
 * joining the boundary annuli of these blocks together in pairs.  The
 * joins must be made so that the fibres are consistent, though it is
 * allowable to reverse the directions of the fibres.  There is no problem
 * with joining two boundary annuli from the same block to each other.
 *
 * Any boundary annulus of a block that is not joined to some other
 * boundary annulus of a block becomes a boundary annulus of the entire
 * region.  In this way, each boundary component of the region (if there
 * are any at all) is formed from a ring of boundary annuli, in the same
 * way that the boundary of a block is.  Note that the routine
 * SatBlock::nextBoundaryAnnulus() can be used to trace around a region
 * boundary.  Like block boundaries, the boundary of a saturated region
 * need not be part of the boundary of the larger triangulation (i.e.,
 * there may be adjacent tetrahedra that are not recognised as part of
 * this saturated structure).
 *
 * The SatRegion class stores a list of its constituent blocks, but it
 * does not directly store which block boundary annuli are joined to
 * which.  This adjacency information is stored within the blocks
 * themselves; see the notes regarding adjacency in the SatBlock class
 * description.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.  Note, however, that
 * the only way to create objects of this class (aside from copying or moving)
 * is via the static search functions, such as find() or beginsRegion().
 *
 * \warning It is crucial that the adjacency information stored in the
 * blocks is consistent with the region containing them.  All this
 * requires is that the blocks are not manipulated externally (e.g.,
 * SatBlock::setAdjacent() is not called on any of the blocks), but
 * instead all adjacency information is managed by this class.
 *
 * \todo \feature Have this class track the boundary components properly,
 * with annuli grouped and oriented according to the region boundaries (as
 * opposed to individual block boundaries).
