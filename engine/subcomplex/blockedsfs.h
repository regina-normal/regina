 * Represents a blocked Seifert fibred space (possibly with boundary).
 * This is a particular type of triangulation of a Seifert fibred space,
 * where this triangulation is formed from a single saturated region.
 * A saturated region is in turn formed from saturated blocks by identifying
 * their boundary annuli in pairs; see the SatRegion class for details.
 *
 * Note that the routines writeName() and writeTeXName() do \e not
 * offer enough information to uniquely identify the triangulation,
 * since this essentially requires a 2-dimensional assembling of
 * saturated blocks.  For full detail, writeTextLong() may be used instead.
 *
 * The optional StandardTriangulation routine manifold() is
 * implemented for this class, but homology() is not.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.  Note, however, that
 * the only way to create objects of this class (aside from copying or moving)
 * is via the static member function recognise().
