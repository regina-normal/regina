/**
 * Represents a layered chain pair component of a triangulation.
 *
 * A layered chain pair consists of two layered chains (as described by
 * class LayeredChain) glued together in a particular way.
 *
 * Orient the hinge edges and diagonals of each chain so they all point
 * in the same direction around the solid tori formed by each layered
 * chain (a \e diagonal is an edge between the two top triangular faces or an
 * edge between the two bottom triangular faces of a layered chain).
 *
 * The two top faces of the first chain are glued to a top and bottom
 * face of the second chain, and the two bottom faces of the first chain
 * are glued to a top and bottom face of the second chain.
 *
 * The four oriented diagonals are all identified as a single edge.  Of the
 * remaining unglued edges (two hinge edges and two non-hinge edges per chain),
 * each hinge edge of one chain must be identified to a non-hinge edge of
 * the other chain and vice versa.  From here the face identifications are
 * uniquely determined.
 *
 * Note that a layered chain pair in which one of the chains contains
 * only one tetrahedron is in fact a layered loop with a twist
 * (see class LayeredLoop).
 *
 * All optional StandardTriangulation routines are implemented for this class.
 *
 * This class supports copying but does not implement separate move operations,
 * since its internal data is so small that copying is just as efficient.
 * It implements the C++ Swappable requirement via its own member and global
 * swap() functions, for consistency with the other StandardTriangulation
 * subclasses.  Note that the only way to create these objects (aside from
 * copying or moving) is via the static member function recognise().
