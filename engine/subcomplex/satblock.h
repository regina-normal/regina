/**
 * Represents a saturated block in a Seifert fibred space.  A saturated
 * block is a connected set of tetrahedra built from a subset of fibres
 * (no fibres may enter or exit the boundary of the block).  In addition,
 * the boundary of this block must be a ring of saturated annuli, as
 * described by the SatAnnulus class.  Aside from this ring of saturated
 * annuli, there may be no other boundary triangles within the block.
 *
 * The boundary annuli are numbered consecutively as illustrated below,
 * where the markings 0 and 1 within the triangles represent the first
 * and second triangle of each annulus (see the SatAnnulus class notes for
 * details).  Note that the following diagram is viewed from \e inside
 * the block.
 *
 * <pre>
 *               -+---+---+---+---+---+---+-
 *                |0 /|0 /|0 /|0 /|0 /|0 /|
 *            ... | / | / | / | / | / | / | ...
 *                |/ 1|/ 1|/ 1|/ 1|/ 1|/ 1|
 *               -+---+---+---+---+---+---+-
 * Annulus #  ...  n-2 n-1  0   1   2   3   ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * The ring of boundary annuli may optionally be twisted, so that together
 * the annuli form a long Mobius band.  In this case, for the purposes of
 * labelling and marking annuli, the twist occurs between annuli n-1 and 0.
 * Be careful when dealing with blocks with twisted boundaries, since
 * with twists it is possible to identify an edge with itself in reverse
 * (thus producing something that is not a 3-manifold triangulation).
 *
 * Each saturated block corresponds to a piece of the base orbifold of the
 * larger Seifert fibred space.  For the purpose of connecting the base
 * orbifold together, we assume that the boundary of this particular
 * piece runs horizontally in the diagram above (specifically following
 * the horizontal edges of the boundary annuli, as described in the
 * SatAnnulus class notes).  Insisting on such a boundary may lead to
 * (1,\a k) twists within the block; these are accounted for by the
 * virtual adjustSFS() routine.
 *
 * Saturated blocks are generally joined to one another (or themselves)
 * along their boundary annuli.  For this purpose, each saturated block
 * contains a list of which annulus of this block is adjacent to which
 * annulus of which other block.  Adjacencies may be \e reflected, meaning
 * that the adjacent annulus has its fibres reversed (i.e., the adjacent
 * annulus has undergone an up-to-down reflection); they may also be
 * \e backwards, meaning that the first triangle of one annulus is joined to
 * the second triangle of the other (and vice versa).
 *
 * This is an abstract base class: its subclasses correspond to different
 * combinatorial constructions (or in some cases, parameterised families
 * of constructions).  Each subclass of SatBlock:
 *
 * - must override all pure virtual functions (of course);
 *
 * - should override transform() if the subclass contains additional
 *   data that needs to be altered when an isomorphism is applied;
 *
 * - should not override writeTextLong(), since SatBlock uses short output only.
 *
 * SatBlock does not support value semantics: blocks cannot be copied,
 * swapped, or manually constructed.  Their memory is managed by the
 * SatRegion class (or in special cases the SatBlockModel class), and their
 * locations in memory define them.  See SatRegion for further details.

         * this block.  This description does not make sense for blocks
         * with twisted boundary; the twisted case is discussed below.
         *
         * If the argument \a reflect is \c true, it should be assumed

         * Regarding the signs of exceptional fibres:  Consider a

         * annuli 0,1,... and follows the fibres \a q times from bottom

         * then the situation becomes more complex.  It can be proven
         * that such a block must contain a twisted reflector boundary
         * in the base orbifold (use Z_2 homology with fibre-reversing
         * paths to show that the base orbifold must contain another
         * twisted boundary component, and then recall that real boundaries
         * are not allowed inside blocks).

         * In this twisted boundary case, it should be assumed that the

         * that are required (there may well be none).  That is, the

         * space over the annulus with one twisted reflector boundary (and
         * one twisted puncture corresponding to the block boundary) had
         * been replaced by this block.  In particular, this routine should

         * Suppose that all saturated blocks are merged together according
         * to adjacent boundary annuli, forming larger saturated structures.
         * The remaining annuli that do not have adjacent blocks will
         * group together to form several large boundary rings.  Note that
         * each boundary ring might involve annuli from several
         * different blocks, and might or might not have a twist (thus
         * forming a large Klein bottle instead of a large torus).
         *
         * This routine is used to trace around such a boundary ring.  It is
         * assumed that annulus \a thisAnnulus of this block forms part
         * of a boundary ring (i.e., it has no adjacent block).  This
         * routine will then return the next/previous annulus around from
         * this in the large boundary ring.  Here "next" means in the direction
         * following from the second triangle of this annulus, and
         * "previous" means in the direction following from the first triangle;
         * the boolean argument \a followPrev controls which we will be used.
         * This next/previous annulus might belong to another block, or it
         * might even be this original annulus again.
         *
         * The next/previous annulus itself is not returned, but rather a
         * reference as to how it appears within its enclosing saturated block.
         * Specifically, a block and corresponding annulus number will be
         * included as the first two elements of the returned tuple.
         *
         * It is possible that the next/previous annulus as it appears within
         * the returned block is oriented differently from how it appears
         * within this large boundary ring.  For this reason, two booleans are
         * returned also.  The third element of the returned tuple will
         * describe whether the annulus is reflected vertically as it
         * appears within the large boundary ring (i.e., the first and
         * second triangles remain the same but the fibre direction is
         * reversed).  Similarly, the fourth element of the tuple will describe
         * whether the annulus is reflected horizontally as it appears
         * within the large boundary ring (i.e., first and second triangles
         * are switched but the fibre direction is unchanged).
         *
         * It is possible that both a horizontal and vertical reflection
         * take place.  Note that any kind of reflection will also
         * affect the locations of the 0/1/2 markings as described in
         * the SatAnnulus class notes.
         *
         * Finally, note that if the large boundary ring is twisted
         * (i.e., it forms a Klein bottle), then following the entire
         * boundary ring around using this routine will bring you back to
         * the starting annulus but with the vertical reflection flag set.
         *
         * \pre Annulus \a thisAnnulus of this block has no block
         * adjacent to it.
         *
         * \warning If you wish to trace around an entire boundary
         * ring, you will need to adjust the argument \a followPrev
         * according to whether or not the current annulus
         * is reflected horizontally (since, under a horizontal
         * reflection, "next" becomes "previous" and vice versa).
