 * recognise them at all.  These have not been in use since mid-2002.
 * The only file formats that this class now recognises are Regina's newer

 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement, though it does not implement (or need) its own custom swap()
 * function.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.
