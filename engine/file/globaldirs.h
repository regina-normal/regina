         * the type of build and the location of the given executable (which
         * is typically the program currently being run).
         * It can identify the correct paths for fixed XDG installations,

         * tree is either an immediate subdirectory of the source root,

         *
         * This routine respects the following environment variables,
         * and these will take precedence over any automatic deductions:
         *
         * - REGINA_HOME, if present and non-empty, will determine Regina's

         *   <tt>$REGINA_HOME/data/census</tt>.

         *   directory containing Regina's python module as returned by
         *   pythonModule().
         *
         * If you have an unusual setup where Regina cannot deduce the paths
         * correctly, you can always call setDirs() to set the paths
         * explicitly yourself.
