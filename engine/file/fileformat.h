 *
 * In constrast, they do not capture incremental changes (e.g., new elements
 * in data files that correspond to new features of Regina, which are simply
 * ignored when an older version of Regina sees them).
 *
 * Put differently: within each generation, the file formats should be
 * considered "interoperable", in that they maintain both forward and backward
 * compatibility as far as possible.  In contrast, between generations
 * the file formats are not compatible at all, and require some form of
 * explicit conversion.
 *
 * Of course, Regina can still read and write some older generation formats;
 * these abilities are indicated alongside the constants below.
