/**
 * Used to write one of Regina's objects to XML.  This is typically used
 * by wrapped packets: the XML output code for PacketOf<T> uses XMLWriter<T>
 * to do the "real" work.
 *
 * By calling openPre(), openPost(), writeContent() and close() in turn,
 * this object should output a single XML element (typically with
 * internal character data and/or child elements) that represents a
 * single Regina object of type \a T.
 *
 * Some of Regina's data types (e.g., normal surface/hypersurface lists
 * and angle structure lists) require the underlying triangulation to be
 * written to file beforehand.  The user of this class is responsible for
 * making sure that this happens - specifically, this means:
 *
 * - you should check the class constant XMLWriter<T>::requiresTriangulation
 *   to determine if the triangulation might need to be written;
 *
 * - if so, you should ensure that the triangulation has been written
 *   and then call XMLWriter<T>::wroteTriangulation(id) to communicate
 *   back to this class the corresponding packet ID;
 *
 * - only then can you call openPre() to begin writing this object to file.
 *
 * The generic implementation of PacketOf<T>::writeXMLPacketData()
 * handles all of this correctly.  The constant requiresTriangulation
 * and the function wroteTriangulation() are inherited through
 * the helper class XMLWriterRequiresTriangulation<T>.
 *
 * For types that can be enclosed in a PacketOf<...> wrapper, \a T should be
 * the underlying mathematical type (so, for example, for links the type
 * \a T should be Link, not PacketOf<Link>).
 *
 * Most functions in this template class have no default implementations,
 * and instead require a specialisation for each type \a T that is to be
 * supported.  The only exceptions are the class constructor and openPost().
