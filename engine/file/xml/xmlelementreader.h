/**
 * Used to read the contents of a single XML element.  Specifically, this
 * class concerns itself with reading and storing the contents between a
 * single opening tag and the corresponding closing tag.  It is not concerned
 * with reading subelements of the element in question, although the contents
 * of subelements will be made available.
 *
 * Generally a subclass of XMLElementReader will be used to receive and
 * store information that you care about.  However, if you simply wish to
 * ignore the contents of a particular XML element (and all of its
 * subelements), you can use class XMLElementReader itself for the
 * element(s) you wish to ignore.
 *
 * When the parser runs through a particular XML element, the routines of
 * the corresponding XMLElementReader will be called as follows.  First
 * startElement() and initialChars() will be called.  Then for each
 * subelement encountered the following processing will take place:
 * startSubElement() will be called to create a new child reader, the entire
 * cycle of parsing routines will be called upon this child reader and
 * then endSubElement() will be called upon the parent reader, \e after
 * which the child reader will be destroyed.  After all subelements have
 * been processed, endElement() will be called.
 *
 * If at any point parsing is aborted, routine abort() will be called
 * upon all active readers and all active readers will be destroyed.
 *
 * To parse an entire XML file using a variety of element readers (all of
 * which may be of different subclasses of XMLElementReader), create a
 * new regina::xml::XMLParser with an XMLCallback as its corresponding
 * callback object.
 *
 * When parsing begins on an entire XML file, an additional call is made:
 * usingParser() will be called on the top-level element reader, so that
 * it can gain direct access to the parser if required.
