/**
 * Represents a packet of information that may be individually edited or
 * operated upon.  Packets are stored in a tree structure, with
 * child/parent relationships; the root of the tree represents a
 * complete Regina data file.
 *
 * There are two types of packets: _innate_ packets, and _wrapped_ packets.
 *
 * - _Innate_ packets are only relevant within the context of a data file.
 *   Examples include containers (which are used to organise the packet tree),
 *   or scripts (which stores Python code with variables bound to other packets
 *   in the tree).  Each innate packet type is represented by its own
 *   customised subclass of Packet (e.g., Container or Script).
 *
 * - _Wrapped_ packets hold some other type, which can also act as a
 *   standalone mathematical object.  Examples include packets that hold
 *   triangulations, links, and normal surface lists.  Each wrapped packet type
 *   is represented by a class of the form PacketOf<Held>, where \a Held
 *   is the underlying mathematical type (e.g., Triangulation<3>, Link,
 *   or NormalSurfaces).
 *
 * Since Regina 7.0, packets are _always_ managed by std::shared_ptr.
 * There are _no_ exceptions to this rule.  The implication of this are:
 *
 * - Every new packet _must_ be wrapped in a std::shared_ptr immediately
 *   after construction.  It is recommended that you create new packets using
 *   std::make_shared, not \c new, so you do not forget this.  Many of
 *   Regina's operations on packets will assume that such a std::shared_ptr
 *   exists, and will throw std::bad_weak_ptr exceptions if it does not.
 *
 * - When given an existing raw packet pointer (e.g., as a function argument),
 *   you must _not_ wrap it in a new std::shared_ptr.  This would lead to two
 *   shared pointers "independently" claiming ownership of the packet (which
 *   means the packet would be destroyed earlier than expected).  If you need
 *   to convert a raw Packet* into a std::shared_ptr, you can use the member
 *   function shared_from_this() (inherited from std::enable_shared_from_this).
 *
 * Parent packets own their children, but children do not own their parents.
 * This has the following impliciations for destruction:
 *
 * - If you have a shared pointer to the root of the packet tree, then this
 *   will keep the entire packet tree alive.
 *
 * - To destroy a child packet but not its parent, just call makeOrphan() on
 *   the child.  This will remove the child from the tree, and then destroy
 *   the child once your last shared pointer to it goes out of scope.
 *
 * - If you destroy a parent but you are also holding another shared pointer to
 *   one of its children, then that child will _not_ be destroyed.  It will
 *   instead become orphaned, and will become the root of its own (smaller)
 *   packet tree.
 *
 * The old Packet::safeDelete() function has been removed, since you should
 * not be manually destroying packets at all now (instead just wait for
 * the last std::shared_ptr to be destroyed).
 *
 * There are different requirements when creating a new packet type.
 *
 * To create a new innate packet type:
 *
 * - Add a new type constant to the PacketType enum;
 *
 * - Add corresponding cases to the routines in PacketInfo;
 *
 * - Create a new subclass \a C of Packet, which begins with the REGINA_PACKET
 *   macro and implements all pure virtual functions (except for those
 *   already provided by REGINA_PACKET);
 *
 * - Declare and implement a copy constructor, copy assignment operator,
 *   and member/global swap functions, whose arguments use the derived
 *   class \a C (not the base class Packet);
 *
 * - Add an appropriate case to XMLPacketReader::startSubElement(), to
 *   support reading from file;
 *
 * - For every routine in \a C that edits the packet contents, declare a
 *   Packet::ChangeEventSpan on the stack while the modification takes place
 *   so that listeners are notified (see the discussion below on event
 *   listeners).
 *
 * To create a new wrapped packet type that holds an object of type \a Held:
 *
 * - Add a new type constant \a T to the PacketType enum;
 *
 * - Add a specialisation of the template constant packetTypeHolds<Held>,
 *   which should take the value \a T;
 *
 * - Add corresponding cases to the routines in PacketInfo;
 *
 * - Add PacketData<Held> as a new base class for \a Held (this is very
 *   lightweight, just adding a single enum variable);
 *
 * - Add specialisations that implement the routines in XMLWriter<Held>, to
 *   support writing to file;
 *
 * - Add an appropriate case to XMLPacketReader::startSubElement(), to
 *   support reading from file;
 *
 * - For every routine in \a Held that edits the packet contents, declare a
 *   Held::ChangeEventSpan on the stack while the modification takes place.
 *   This is again lightweight (if an object does not belong to a packet
 *   then the cost is just two integer comparisions), and it will ensure that
 *   if the object _does_ belong to a packet then listeners are notified.
 *
 * External objects can listen for events on packets, such as when packets
 * are changed or about to be destroyed.  This is useful (for example)
 * when keeping a graphical user interface in sync with any changes that
 * might be happening within the engine and/or via users' python scripts.
 * See the PacketListener class notes for details.
 *
 * Regina's packet types do not support C++ move semantics, since this would
 * interfere with the structure of the packet tree.  They do support copy
 * construction, copy assignment and swaps, but only in the derived packet
 * classes (e.g., you cannot assign from the polymorphic base class Packet).
 * Moreover, these operations only copy/swap the mathematical content, not the
 * packet infrastructure (e.g., they do not touch packet labels, or the packet
 * tree, or event listeners).

         * using its own internal ChangeEventSpan.  (An example of this

         * pair of change events.

 *
 * This is the class used for all of Regina's _wrapped packet types_.
 * See the Packet class notes for general information about packets, and
 * about the differences between _wrapped_ and _innate_ packet types.
 *
 * You can use a PacketOf<Held> in much the same way as you can use a "raw"
 * object of type \a Held.  This class inherits the full interface from
 * \a Held: you can query and manipulate its objects in the same way,
 * and (using the std::in_place constructors) you can create them in the
 * same way also.
 *
 * There are some important differences, however:
 *
 * - The \a Held class will typically support full value semantics, with full
 *   support for copying, moving, and swapping (as is now common across most
 *   of Regina's API).  In contrast, due the constraints of working with the
 *   packet tree, PacketOf<Held> objects are typically passed by pointer,
 *   copies and swaps do not touch the tree structure, and moves are not
 *   supported at all.
 *
 * - The \a Held class will typically _not_ be polymorphic.  In contrast,
 *   PacketOf<Held> aquires polymorphism through its inherited Packet
 *   interface.
 *
 * Like all packet types, this class does not support C++ move semantics
 * since this would interfere with the structure of the packet tree.
 * It does support copy construction, copy assignment and swaps; however,
 * these operations only copy/swap the mathematical content, not the packet
 * infrastructure (e.g., they do not touch packet labels, or the packet
 * tree, or event listeners).
 *
 * \python Since Python does not support templates, this class
 * will have a name of the form PacketOfHeld.  For example, the C++ class
 * Link is wrapped by the Python class \c PacketOfLink, and the C++ class
 * Triangulation<3> is wrapped by the Python class \c PacketOfTriangulation3.

         *
         * - If the underlying \a Held object is not actually part of a larger
         *   PacketOf<Held>, then this ChangeEventSpan will do nothing.
         *   In such a scenario, the ChangeEventSpan constructor and
         *   destructor are both extremely cheap (each will make just a
         *   single integer comparison).
         *
         * - If the underlying \a Held object _is_ part of a PacketOf<Held>,
         *   then this ChangeEventSpan will ensure that the appropriate
         *   packet events are fired (just like Packet::ChangeEventSpan).
         *
         * Just like Packet::ChangeEventSpan, these objects can be nested
         * so that only the outermost object will fire change events;
         * furthermore, PacketData<Held>::ChangeEventSpan objects and
         * Packet::ChangeEventSpan objects can be nested within each other.
         *
         * Also, just like Packet::ChangeEventSpan and Packet::ChangeEventGroup,
         * there is an equivalent type PacketData::ChangeEventGroup whose
         * purpose is to indicate to the reader that the an object is being
         * used _only_ to merge many event pairs into a single event pair.
         *
         * When working with PacketData<Triangulation<3>>, this class
         * includes special code that nullifies a SnapPea triangulation
         * when its inherited Triangulation<3> data changes unexpectedly.
         * See the SnapPeaTriangulation class for details.
         *
         * ChangeEventSpan objects are not copyable, movable or swappable.
         * In particular, Regina does not offer any way for a ChangeEventSpan
         * to transfer its duty (i.e., firing events upon destruction) to
         * another object.

/**
 * An object that can be registered to listen for packet events.
 *
 * A packet listener can be registered to listen for events on a
 * packet by calling Packet::listen().
 *
 * Each time that one of the events listed in this class occurs, the packet
 * will call the appropriate callback routine for all registered listeners.
 *
 * These events come in future/past pairs: packetToBeChanged() and
 * packetWasChanged(), childToBeAdded() and childWasAdded(), and so on.
 * These event pairs are mutually exclusive: any event will
 * cause at most one pair of callback routines to be called for each
 * (packet, listener) pair.  For instance, if a packet is renamed then
 * packetToBeRenamed() and packetWasRenamed() will be called but
 * packetToBeChanged() and packetWasChanged() will not.
 *
 * As a special case, when a packet is destroyed there is only the one
 * event packetBeingDestroyed(), since this is called _during_ the packet
 * destructor (at a time when the set of listeners is still available, but
 * some of the other packet data may have already been destroyed).
 *
 * No guarantees are made as to the order in which the different packet
 * listeners are notified of an event.
 *
 * When a listener is destroyed, it is automatically unregistered
 * from any packets to which it is currently listening.  Similarly, when
 * a packet is destroyed all listeners are automatically unregistered.
 *
 * To listen for packet events using your own callback routines, you
 * would typically implement a subclass of PacketListener that overrides
 * only those callbacks that you are interested in.  Be aware that:
 *
 * - Callbacks are called for each listener, one at a time, in the same
 *   thread in which the event occurred.
 *
 * - Callbacks can safely add new packet listeners, but there is no guarantee
 *   as to whether or not the new listeners will be notified of the
 *   specific event currently being processed.
 *
 * - Callbacks can safely remove other listeners, but they must _not_
 *   remove the listener whose callback is currently being called.
 *   The one exception to this is packetBeingDestroyed(), which will
 *   explicitly remove each listener _before_ its callback is called
 *   (which means, for example, the listener can safely delete itself).
 *
 * \warning Subclass authors should be aware of the default copy semantics
 * that this base class provides.  In particular, this base class provides
 * a protected copy constructor and copy assignment operator that will change
 * which packets are being listened to (in the "obvious" way).  As a subclass
 * author, you should understand this inherited behaviour if your subclass
 * constructors and/or assignment operators use these base class operations
 * implicitly.
 *
 * \warning At the time of writing (admittedly long ago now), Qt has only
 * limited support for multithreading.  When working with an existing packet
 * tree in a new thread (not the main thread), the _only_ modification that
 * you may make is to insert new packets.  Modifications of any other type
 * (such as changing, renaming, deleting or reordering existing packets)
 * could lead to a crash within Qt or Xlib when running the GUI.
 * Of course, a new thread may create, modify and delete its own temporary
 * packet trees as it chooses (and it may in fact insert them into a
 * pre-existing packet tree once all modifications are completed).
 * Assuming these restrictions are respected, packet listeners may assume
 * that no routines other than childWasAdded() will be called from a non-main
 * thread.
 *
 * \python You can happily make a pure Python subclass of PacketListener,
 * and packets will call whichever functions you override when events occur,
 * just as they would for a native C++ subclass.
