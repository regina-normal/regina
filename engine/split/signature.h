/**
 * Represents a signature of a splitting surface in a closed 3-manifold
 * triangulation.
 *
 * A <i>splitting surface</i> is (for these purposes) a compact normal surface
 * consisting of precisely one quad per tetrahedron and no other normal
 * (or almost normal) discs.
 *
 * A <i>signature</i> of order <i>n</i> is a string consisting of 2<i>n</i>
 * letters arranged into cycles, where <i>n</i> is the number of quads in the
 * splitting surface.  From a signature, the corresponding splitting
 * surface and then the entire 3-manifold triangulation can be recreated.
 *
 * A signature of order <i>n</i> uses the first <i>n</i> letters of the
 * alphabet, each precisely twice.  Case is important; the meaning of a
 * letter changes according to whether it appears in upper-case or
 * lower-case.
 *
 * Each letter represents an individual quadrilateral (the two
 * occurrences of the letter representing the quadrilateral's two sides).
 * Each cycle represents a chain of quadrilaterals joined together in the
 * splitting surface.  The case of a letter represents in which direction
 * a quadrilateral is traversed within a cycle.
 *
 * Cycles are arranged into <i>cycle groups</i>, where a cycle group
 * consists of a series of consecutive cycles all of the same length.
 *
 * An example of a signature is <tt>(abc)(a)(b)(c)</tt>.  This signature
 * is of order 3 and contains two cycle groups, the first being
 * <tt>(abc)</tt> and the second being <tt>(a)(b)(c)</tt>.
 *
 * A signature cannot represent a splitting surface with more than 26
 * quadrilaterals.
 *
 * For further details on splitting surfaces and their signatures, consult
 * <i>Minimal triangulations and normal surfaces</i>, Burton, PhD thesis,
 * available from the Regina website.
 *
 * This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++ Swappable
 * requirement.  It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever possible,
 * even when passing or returning objects by value.
