         * Forms a census of all splitting surface signatures of the given
         * order.  The order of a signature is the number of quads in the
         * corresponding splitting surface.
         *
         * Each signature will be produced precisely once up to equivalence.
         * Signatures are considered equivalent if they are related by some
         * combination of:
         * - relabelling symbols;
         * - rotating an individual cycle;
         * - inverting an individual cycle (i.e., reversing the cycle and
         *   changing the case of each symbol in the cycle);
         * - reversing all cycles without changing the case of any symbols.
         *
         * Each signature produced will have its cycles ordered by decreasing
         * length.  Each cycle will have at least half of its symbols
         * lower-case.
         *
         * For each signature that is generated, this routine will call
         * \a action (which must be a function or some other callable object).
         *
         * - The first argument to \a action must be a const reference to a
         *   Signature.  This will be the signature that was found.
         *   If \a action wishes to keep the signature, it should take a
         *   deep copy (not a reference), since the signature may be
         *   changed and reused after \a action returns.
         *
         * - The second argument to \a action must be a const reference to a
         *   SigCensus::IsoList.  This will be the list of all automorphisms of
         *   the signature that was found.  Again, if \a action wishes to keep
         *   these automorphisms, it should take a deep copy of this list.
         *
         * - If there are any additional arguments supplied in the list \a args,
         *   then these will be passed as subsequent arguments to \a action.
         *
         * - \a action must return \c void.
         *
         * \warning Currently upper-case symbols in signatures are not supported
         * by this routine; only signatures whose symbols are all lower-case
         * will be produced.
         *
         * \todo \feature Add support for symbols of differing case.
         *
         * \ifacespython This function is available, and \a action may be a
         * pure Python function.  However, \a action cannot take any additional
         * arguments beyond the signature and its automorphisms (and
         * therefore the additional \a args list is omitted here).

         * @param action a function (or other callable object) to call for each
         * signature that is found.

         * \a action, following the initial signature and automorphism
         * arguments.
