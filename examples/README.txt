Regina Census and Examples Directory
------------------------------------

This directory contains several different censuses of triangulations.
Each census file begins with a text packet explaining what the census is
and where the data came from.  You can access these censuses directly
through Regina's main menu:

  File -> Open Example -> ... (choose which census you want)

There are also example files here that illustrate how you can use Regina.
For beginners: try sample-misc.rga, or from Regina's main menu select:

  File -> Open Example -> Introductory Examples

If you are interested in Python scripting, look at the various *.session
files (described below).

The types of files in this directory are:

*.rga:
    Data files that you can open within Regina.

*.session:
    Transcripts of example Python sessions, showing both the user input and
    the corresponding Python output.  You can start a python session from
	the command line by running "regina-python".

*.py:
    The input for the example Python sessions described above.  You can
	feed this input directly into Regina by running:

    regina-python file.py   (where file.py is your chosen input file)
