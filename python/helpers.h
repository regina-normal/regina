 *  This file automatically includes the most commonly-used headers from
 *  python/helpers/, but not all of the headers in python/helpers/.
 *  Specifically, it excludes those headers that introduce non-trivial
 *  complexity to the code and whose use is not widespread across Regina's
 *  Python bindings.
