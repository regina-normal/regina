# It also makes tweaks to account for differences in help() output between
# Python 3.6 vs 3.8 and above (I'm not sure which way Python 3.7 goes),

# the pybind11_object constructor is handled in Python <= 3.11 vs >= 3.12.

# Note that BSD sed does not support \+, which is why we use \{1,\} instead.
# BSD sed also seems to have issues with \s and \S, so we avoid them too.
