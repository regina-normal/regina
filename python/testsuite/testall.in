# Regina - A Normal Surface Theory Calculator
# Python Test Suite Runner
#
# Copyright (c) 2007-2009, Ben Burton
# For further details contact Ben Burton (bab@debian.org).
#
# Usage: testall
#
# Runs the entire Python test suite.  This script searches for files
# named *.test in or beneath the current directory, runs them through
# regina-python, and compares the results byte-by-byte with the
# corresponding *.out files.  Any mismatches are considered to be test
# failures.
#
# This script MUST be run from the python/testsuite directory in the
# build tree.  It runs regina-python directly out of the build tree.
# It does not require regina to be installed on the system (and indeed
# it ignores any installation that it might find).
#
# Because tests might need to access other files within the source tree
# (which might not be the same as the build tree), the corresponding
# python/testsuite directory within the source tree will be passed as an
# argument to each test script.
