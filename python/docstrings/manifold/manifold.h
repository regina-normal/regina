correspond to different families of 3-manifolds.

Each subclass:

* may optionally override construct(), homology() and/or
  writeStructure(), if they are able to provide this functionality;

* must _not_ override writeTextShort() or writeTextLong(), since these
  routines are not virtual, and are provided directly by the Manifold
  base class;

* must provide value semantics (including at least a copy constructor
  and assignment operator);

* must provide comparison operators (== and !=);

* must provide member and global swap functions, for consistency
  across all Manifold subclasses.)doc";

static const char *__lt =
R"doc(Determines in a fairly ad-hoc fashion whether this representation of
this 3-manifold is "smaller" than the given representation of the
given 3-manifold.

The ordering imposed on 3-manifolds is purely aesthetic on the part of
the author, and is subject to change in future versions of Regina.

The ordering also depends on the particular representation of the
3-manifold that is used. As an example, different representations of
the same Seifert fibred space might well be ordered differently.

All that this routine really offers is a well-defined way of ordering
3-manifold representations.

.. warning::
    Currently this routine is only implemented in full for closed
    3-manifolds. For most classes of bounded 3-manifolds, this routine
    simply compares the strings returned by name().

Parameter ``compare``:
    the 3-manifold representation with which this will be compared.

Returns:
    ``True`` if and only if this is "smaller" than the given
    3-manifold representation.)doc";

been implemented. For details of which types of 3-manifolds have
implemented this routine, see the class notes for each corresponding
subclasses of Manifold.

The default implemention of this routine just throws a NotImplemented
exception.

Exception ``NotImplemented``:
    Explicit construction has not yet been implemented for this
    particular 3-manifold.

Exception ``FileError``:
    The construction needs to be read from file (as opposed to
    computed on the fly), but the file is inaccessible or its contents
    cannot be read and parsed correctly. Currently this can only
    happen for the subclass SnapPeaCensusManifold, which reads its
    triangulations from the SnapPea census databases that are
    installed with Regina.

Returns:
    a triangulation of this 3-manifold, if this construction has been
    implemented.)doc";

R"doc(Returns the first homology group of this 3-manifold, if such a routine

evident from its common name. For instance, for an orbit space SÂ³/G
this routine might return the full Seifert structure.

This routine may return the empty string if no additional details are
deemed necessary.

Returns:
    a string describing additional structural details.)doc";

static const char *texName =
R"doc(Returns the common name of this 3-manifold in TeX format. No leading
