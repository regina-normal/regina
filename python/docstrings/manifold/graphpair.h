// Docstring regina::python::doc::GraphPair
static const char *GraphPair =
R"doc(Represents a closed graph manifold formed by joining two bounded
Seifert fibred spaces along a common torus.

Each Seifert fibred space must have just one boundary component,
corresponding to a puncture in the base orbifold (with no fibre-
reversing twist as one travels around this boundary).

The way in which the two spaces are joined is specified by a 2-by-2
matrix *M*. This matrix expresses the locations of the fibres and base
orbifold of the second Seifert fibred space in terms of the first.

More specifically, suppose that *f0* and *o0* are generators of the
common torus, where *f0* represents a directed fibre in the first
Seifert fibred space and *o0* represents the oriented boundary of the
corresponding base orbifold. Likewise, let *f1* and *o1* be generators
of the common torus representing a directed fibre and the base
orbifold of the second Seifert fibred space. Then the curves *f0*,
*o0*, *f1* and *o1* are related as follows:

```
    [f1]       [f0]
    [  ] = M * [  ]
    [o1]       [o0]
```

See the page on notation for Seifert fibred spaces for details on some
of the terminology used above.

The optional Manifold routine homology() is implemented, but the
optional routine construct() is not.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value. Note,
however, that GraphPair still requires a non-trivial (but constant
sized) amount of data to be copied even in a move operation.)doc";

different representations of the same space may be ordered
differently.

All that this routine really offers is a well-defined way of ordering
