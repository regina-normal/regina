// Docstring regina::python::doc::GraphLoop
static const char *GraphLoop =
R"doc(Represents a closed graph manifold formed by joining a single bounded
Seifert fibred space to itself along a torus.

The Seifert fibred space must have two boundary components, each a
torus corresponding to a puncture in the base orbifold (with no fibre-
reversing twist as one travels around the boundary).

The way in which the two torus boundaries are joined together is
specified by a 2-by-2 matrix *M*. This matrix relates the locations of
the fibres and base orbifold on the two boundary tori.

More specifically, suppose that *f0* and *o0* are generators of the
first boundary torus, where *f0* represents a directed fibre in the
Seifert fibred space and *o0* represents the oriented boundary of the
base orbifold. Likewise, let *f1* and *o1* be generators of the second
boundary torus representing a directed fibre and the oriented boundary
of the base orbifold. Then the tori are joined together so that the
curves *f0*, *o0*, *f1* and *o1* become related as follows:

```
    [f1]       [f0]
    [  ] = M * [  ]
    [o1]       [o0]
```

See the page on notation for Seifert fibred spaces for details on some
of the terminology used above.

The optional Manifold routine homology() is implemented, but the
optional routine construct() is not.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value. Note,
however, that GraphLoop still requires a non-trivial (but constant
sized) amount of data to be copied even in a move operation.)doc";
