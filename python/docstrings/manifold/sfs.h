// Docstring regina::python::doc::SFSFibre
static const char *SFSFibre =
R"doc(Represents an exceptional (*alpha*, *beta*) fibre in a Seifert fibred
space.

The first parameter *alpha* must be strictly positive, and the two
parameters *alpha* and *beta* must be coprime.

Note that we allow regular fibres with *alpha* = 1, and we do not
impose range limits on *beta* (thus *beta* may be negative, or it may
be larger than *alpha*). This is to allow more flexibility in routines
such as SFSpace::insertFibre().

These objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with
std::swap(), with no need for any specialised move operations or swap
functions.

.. warning::
    In Regina 4.2.1 and earlier, this class was named
    NExceptionalFibre. The new SFSFibre class was introduced with
    Regina 4.3, and has changed its behaviour (in particular, the
    natural ordering of fibres has changed). Code that was written to
    work with the old NExceptionalFibre class should be looked at
    closely before being adapted to the new SFSFibre class (i.e., it
    may require more than just substituting class names).)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::SFSpace
static const char *SFSpace =
R"doc(Represents a general Seifert fibred space, which may be orientable or
non-orientable. Punctures and reflector boundaries in the base
orbifold are supported.

A Seifert fibred space whose base orbifold has no punctures or
reflector boundaries can be placed into one of the six classes ``o1``,
``o2``, ``n1``, ``n2``, ``n3`` and ``n4``, as detailed on page 88 of
"Seifert Manifolds", Peter Orlik, Springer-Verlag, 1972. These classes
describe whether this base surface is orientable, as well as how many
of its generators give fibre-reversing paths in the 3-manifold.

In the case where the base orbifold has punctures and/or reflector
boundaries, we use the five simplified classes ``bo1``, ``bo2``,
``bn1``, ``bn2`` and ``bn3``. These classes are not standard
terminology (i.e., they have been created explicitly for Regina), and
generally they do not provide enough information to uniquely identify
the 3-manifold. They do however identify whether or not the base
orbifold is orientable, and whether or not it contains any fibre-
reversing paths.

When describing punctures and reflector boundaries, a _twisted_
boundary is one that gives a fibre-reversing path, and an _untwisted_
boundary is one around which the direction of fibres is preserved.

Exceptional fibres are sorted first by *alpha* (the index) and then by
*beta*. The obstruction constant *b* is stored separately, though in
output routines such as name() and structure() it is merged in with
the exceptional fibres. Specifically, it is merged in with the *beta*
of the final exceptional fibre (replacing it with ``beta + b.alpha``),
or if there are no exceptional fibres then it is presented as a single
(1,b) fibre.

The Manifold routines homology() and construct() are only implemented
in some cases. The homology() routine is implemented if and only if
the base orbifold has no punctures. The construct() routine is
implemented only for lens spaces and Seifert fibred spaces over the
2-sphere without punctures or reflector boundaries.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value. Note,
however, that SFSpace still requires a non-trivial (but constant
sized) amount of data to be copied even in a move operation.

.. warning::
    In Regina 4.2.1 and earlier, this class was named NSFS. As of
    Regina 4.3, this class was renamed due to significant changes of
    behaviour (it became more general, and also now keeps the
    obstruction parameter *b* separate). Code that was written to work
    with the old NSFS class should be looked at closely before being
    adapted to the new SFSpace class (i.e., it may require more than
    just substituting class names).)doc";

Parameter ``punctures``:
    the number of untwisted ordinary boundary components of the base

future versions of Regina. It also depends upon the particular
representation, so that different representations of the same space
may be ordered differently.

Note that this operation may alter which of the classes described by
ClassType this space belongs to.

The exceptional fibres and the obstruction constant *b* are not

bottle boundary.

The exceptional fibres and the obstruction constant *b* are not
modified by this routine.

Parameter ``twisted``:
    ``True`` if the new punctures should be twisted (i.e., their
    boundaries should be fibre-reversing), or ``False`` if the new

Each addition of a reflector boundary component is equivalent to
removing a disc from the base orbifold and replacing it with an
annulus with one reflector boundary.

In the untwisted case, it has the effect of removing a trivially
fibred solid torus from the overall 3-manifold and replacing it with
an appropriately fibred twisted I-bundle over the torus.

The exceptional fibres and the obstruction constant *b* are not
modified by this routine.

Parameter ``twisted``:
