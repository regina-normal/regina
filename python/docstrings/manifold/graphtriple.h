// Docstring regina::python::doc::GraphTriple
static const char *GraphTriple =
R"doc(Represents a closed graph manifold formed by joining three bounded
Seifert fibred spaces along their torus boundaries.

There must be one Seifert fibred space at either end, each with a
single torus boundary (corresponding to a single puncture in the base
orbifold, with no fibre-reversing twist around this puncture). Each of
these end spaces is joined to the space in the centre, which has two
disjoint torus boundaries (corresponding to two punctures in the base
orbifold, again with no fibre-reversing twists around these
punctures).

This configuration is illustrated in the diagram below. The large
boxes represent the bounded Seifert fibred spaces, and the small
tunnels show how their boundaries are joined.

```

The way in which each pair of spaces is joined is specified by a
2-by-2 matrix. This matrix expresses the locations of the fibres and
base orbifold of the corresponding end space in terms of the central
space. **Note that these are not the same matrices that appear in the
manifold name in the census data files!** See the warning below.

More specifically, consider the matrix *M* that describes the joining
of the central space and the first end space (marked above as end
space 0). Suppose that *f* and *o* are generators of the common
boundary torus, where *f* represents a directed fibre in the central
space and *o* represents the oriented boundary of the corresponding
base orbifold. Likewise, let *f0* and *o0* be generators of the common
boundary torus representing a directed fibre and the base orbifold of
the first end space. Then the curves *f*, *o*, *f0* and *o0* are
related as follows:

```
    [f0]       [f ]
    [  ] = M * [  ]
    [o0]       [o ]
```

Likewise, let matrix *M*' describe the joining of the central space
and the second end space (marked in the diagram above as end space 1).
Let *f*' and *o*' be curves on the common boundary torus representing
the fibres and the base orbifold of the central space, and let *f1*
and *o1* be curves on this same torus representing the fibres and the
base orbifold of the second end space. Then the curves *f*', *o*',
*f1* and *o1* are related as follows:

```
    [f1]        [f']
    [  ] = M' * [  ]
    [o1]        [o']
```

See the page on notation for Seifert fibred spaces for details on some
of the terminology used above.

The optional Manifold routine homology() is implemented, but the
optional routine construct() is not.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value. Note,
however, that GraphTriple still requires a non-trivial (but constant
sized) amount of data to be copied even in a move operation.

.. warning::
    The 2-by-2 matrices used in this class are _not_ the same matrices
    that appear in the manifold name returned by name() and texName()
    and seen in the census data files. The matrices used in this class
    work from the inside out, describing the boundary torus on each
    end space in terms of a boundary torus on the central space. The
    matrices used in the manifold name work from left to right in the
    diagram above, describing a boundary torus on the central space or
    rightmost end space in terms of a boundary torus on the leftmost
    end space or central space respectively. The upshot of all this is
    that **the first matrix becomes inverted** (and the second matrix
    remains unchanged). It is likely that future versions of Regina
    will replace this class with a more general class that (amongst
    other things) removes this inconsistency.)doc";

The ordering imposed on graph manifolds is purely aesthetic on the
part of the author, and is subject to change in future versions of

different representations of the same space may be ordered
differently.

All that this routine really offers is a well-defined way of ordering
