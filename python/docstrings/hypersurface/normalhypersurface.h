// Docstring regina::python::doc::NormalHypersurface
static const char *NormalHypersurface =
R"doc(Represents a single normal hypersurface in a 4-manifold triangulation.

The normal hypersurface is described internally by an integer vector
(discussed in more detail below). Since different hypersurfaces may
use different vector encodings, you should not rely on the raw vector
entries unless absolutely necessary. Instead, the query routines such
as tetrahedra(), prisms(), edgeWeight() and so on are independent of
the underlying vector encoding being used.

Note that non-compact hypersurfaces (surfaces with infinitely many
pieces) are allowed; in these cases, the corresponding coordinate
lookup routines will return LargeInteger::infinity where appropriate.

Since Regina 7.0, you can modify or even destroy the original
triangulation that was used to create this normal hypersurface. If you
do, then this normal hypersurface will automatically make a private
copy of the original triangulation as an ongoing reference. Different
normal hypersurfaces can all share the same private copy, so this is
not an expensive process.

Internally, a normal hypersurface is represented by a
Vector<LargeInteger> (possibly using a different coordinate system
from the one in which the hypersurfaces were originally enumerated).
This contains a block of coordinates for each pentachoron, in order
from the first pentachoron to the last. Each block begins with five
tetrahedron coordinates (always), followed by ten prisms coordinates
(always) - unlike the 3-dimensional world, there are currently no
optional coordinates that might or might not be stored (though this
could change in future versions of Regina). Therefore the vector that
is stored will always have length 15*n*, where *n* is the number of
pentachora in the underlying triangulation.

When adding support for a new coordinate system:

* The file hypercoords.h must be updated. This includes a new enum
  value for HyperCoords, a new case for the HyperEncoding constructor,
  and new cases for the functions in HyperInfo. Do not forget to
  update the python bindings for HyperCoords also.

* The global routines makeEmbeddedConstraints() and
  makeMatchingEquations() should be updated to incorporate the new
  coordinate system.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.)doc";

_simultaneously_.

Local compatibility can be formulated in terms of normal piece types.
Two normal hypersurfaces are locally compatible if and only if they
together use at most two prism piece types per pentachoron; moreover,
if there _are_ two prism piece types within a single pentachoron then
these prism types are non-intersecting.

If one of the two hypersurfaces breaks the local compatibility
constraints on its own (for instance, it contains two conflicting
prism types within the same pentachoron), then this routine will
return ``False`` regardless of what the other hypersurface contains.

Precondition:
    Both this and the given normal hypersurface live within the same
    4-manifold triangulation.

Parameter ``other``:
    the other hypersurface to test for local compatibility with this
    hypersurface.

Returns:
    ``True`` if the two hypersurfaces are locally compatible, or
    ``False`` if they are not.)doc";

R"doc(Returns the number of prism pieces of the given type in this normal
hypersurface. A prism piece type is identified by specifying a
pentachoron and an edge of that pentachoron; prisms of this type will
then separate edge *i* of the pentachoron from triangle *i* of the
pentachoron.

Parameter ``pentIndex``:
    the index in the triangulation of the pentachoron in which the
    requested prisms reside; this should be between 0 and
    Triangulation<4>::size()-1 inclusive.

Parameter ``prismType``:
    specifies the edge of the given pentachoron that this prism
    separates from the opposite triangle; this should be between 0 and

The given vector must represent a normal hypersurface within the given
triangulation, using the given vector encoding.

* If the given encoding does not already store tetrahedron
  coordinates, then the vector will be modified directly to use a new
  encoding that does, and this new encoding will be returned.

* If the given encoding does already store tetrahedra, then this
  routine will do nothing and immediately return *enc*.

Parameter ``tri``:
    the triangulation in which the normal hypersurface lives.

Parameter ``vector``:
    an integer vector that encodes a normal hypersurface within *tri*;
    this will be modified directly.

Parameter ``enc``:
    the encoding used by the given integer vector.

static const char *scaleDown =

multiple with integer coordinates.

Note that the scaling factor will be independent of which internal
vector encoding is used. This is essentially because integer prism
coordinates (which are stored in every encoding) are enough to
guarantee integer tetrahedron coordinates (which might or might not be
stored).

Returns:
    the integer by which the original hypersurface was divided (i.e.,
    the gcd of all normal coordinates in the original hypersurface).
    This will always be strictly positive.)doc";

This and the given normal hypersurface do not need to live in the same

    the index in the triangulation of the pentachoron in which the
    requested pieces reside; this should be between 0 and
    Triangulation<4>::size()-1 inclusive.

Parameter ``vertex``:
    the vertex of the given pentachoron around which the requested

The triangulation will be simplified via
Triangulation<3>::intelligentSimplify(), which means that the
tetrahedra of the final triangulation are not likely to correspond to
any particular tetrahedron/prism pieces of this normal hypersurface.

Precondition:
    This normal hypersurface is compact and embedded.

static const char *triangulation =

This will be a snapshot frozen in time of the triangulation that was
originally passed to the NormalHypersurface constructor.

This will return a correct result even if the original triangulation
has since been modified or destroyed. However, in order to ensure this
behaviour, it is possible that at different points in time this
function may return references to different C++ objects.

The rules for using the triangulation() reference are:

* Do not keep the resulting reference as a long-term reference or
  pointer of your own, since in time you may find yourself referring
  to the wrong object (see above). Just call this function again.

* You must respect the read-only nature of the result (i.e., you must
  not cast the constness away). The snapshotting process detects
  modifications, and modifying the frozen snapshot may result in an
  exception being thrown.

Returns:
    a reference to the underlying triangulation.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::NormalHypersurface_::vector
static const char *vector =
R"doc(Gives read-only access to the integer vector that Regina uses
internally to represent this hypersurface.

Note that this vector might not use the same coordinate system in
which the hypersurfaces were originally enumerated. (For example, this
vector will always include tetrahedron coordinates, even if the
surfaces were originally enumerated in prism coordinates.) You can
call encoding() to find out precisley how the coordinates of this
vector should be interpreted.

See the NormalHypersurface class notes for information on how this
vector is structured.

.. note::
    If you wish to access the numbers of tetrahedra, prisms and so on,
    you should use the functions tetrahedra(), prisms(), etc., which
    do not require any knowledge of the internal vector encoding that
    this hypersurface uses.

    the output stream to which the XML should be written.

Parameter ``list``:
