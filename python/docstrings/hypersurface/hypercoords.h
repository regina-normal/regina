enumerating and/or displaying normal hypersurfaces within 4-manifold
triangulations.

// Docstring regina::python::doc::HyperEncoding
static const char *HyperEncoding =
R"doc(Indicates precisely how a normal hypersurface within a 4-manifold
triangulation is encoded by an integer vector.

Normal hypersurfaces do not always store their internal vectors in the
same coordinate system that was used to enumerate the surfaces, and
indeed an isolated hypersurface does not know _how_ it was originally
created.

Therefore each normal hypersurface keeps a small amount of data,
represented by this class, so that it knows how to interpret its
internal integer vector. This data also remembers properties of the
enumeration process that can be used for optimisations (e.g., the
knowledge that, even if the vector stores tetrahedron coordinates, the
surface cannot contain any vertex linking components).

Encodings have the important property that any rational multiple of a
normal hypersurface *s* can always be stored using the same encoding
as is used for *s*. (In particular, taking a rational multiple will
not invalidate any of the property flags in the encoding.)

These objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with
std::swap(), with no need for any specialised move operations or swap
functions.)doc";

hypersurface coordinate systems.

This class has become much simpler and more stripped-down since Regina

Regina 6.0.1 and earlier can now be accessed through the new
HyperEncoding class.)doc";

This coordinate system is for display only: Regina can view
hypersurfaces in this coordinate system, but it cannot use it to
enumerate or create hypersurfaces.)doc";

this and the given encoding.

More precisely, the encoding that is returned is the "simplest"
possible encoding that is capable of holding the sum of two normal
hypersurfaces that use this and the given encoding respectively.

Parameter ``rhs``:
    the encoding to combine with this.

Returns:

hypersurface coordinate system. This is the encoding that you would
use with a "pen and paper" enumeration of hypersurfaces in the given
coordinate system, with no further conversion, optimisation, or post-
processing.

Note that, when Regina enumerates hypersurfaces in the given
coordinate system, it might choose to post-process the resulting
vectors to use a different encoding. (In the 3-dimensional world, for
example, normal surfaces enumerated in quad coordinates are post-
processed and stored in standard coordinates.)

If *coords* is not one of the coordinate systems that Regina can use
to enumerate normal hypersurfaces, then the resulting encoding will be
invalid, and valid() will return ``False``.

Parameter ``coords``:
    one of Regina's normal hypersurface coordinate systems.)doc";

encoding to be non-compact. Here "non-compact" refers to a surface
with infinitely many normal pieces. See
NormalHypersurface::isCompact() for details.

This is typically information that is inherited from whoever
enumerated or created the hypersurface that uses this encoding.

If this returns ``True``, it does not mean that the hypersurface does
actually contain infinitely many normal pieces; it simply means that
the user will need to test this themselves. If this returns ``False``,
however, it is guaranteed that the hypersurface is compact, with no
further testing required.

Returns:
    ``True`` if it is possible that the hypersurface might be non-
    compact.)doc";

R"doc(Returns whether it is possible for a normal hypersurface using this
encoding to include one or more vertex linking components.

This is typically information that is inherited from whoever
enumerated or created the hypersurface that uses this encoding.

If this returns ``True``, it does not mean that the hypersurface does
actually contain vertex linking components; it simply means that the
user will need to test this themselves. If this returns ``False``,
however, it is guaranteed that the hypersurface does _not_ contain any
vertex linking components, with no further testing required.

Returns:
    ``True`` if it is possible that the hypersurface might contain one
    or more vertex linking components.)doc";

This is a partner routine to intValue(): for any encoding *enc*, the
encoding ``fromIntValue(enc.intValue())`` is always equal to *enc*.

The main purpose of intValue() and fromIntValue() is to support
reading and writing hypersurfaces to/from Regina's XML file format.

Parameter ``value``:
    an integer that represents an encoding, typically obtained by
    calling intValue().

Returns:
    the corresponding encoding.)doc";

static const char *intValue =
R"doc(Exports this encoding as an integer.

The exact value of the integer is meant to be opaque, in the sense
that it can only be used with fromIntValue(). End users are not meant
to pull it apart and analyse it (this is what the other query routines
in this class are for).

The main purpose of intValue() and fromIntValue() is to support
reading and writing hypersurfaces to/from Regina's XML file format.

It is guaranteed that 0 will never be the integer value of a
(correctly constructed) encoding.

Returns:
    an integer that represents this encoding.)doc";

R"doc(Returns whether this describes a vector encoding of normal
hypersurfaces.

The only case where this would be ``False`` is if you create an
encoding using either (1) a coordinate system that Regina does not use
for enumeration; or (2) another invalid encoding.

Returns:
    ``True`` if and only if this is a valid encoding.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::HyperEncoding_::withTetrahedra
static const char *withTetrahedra =
R"doc(Returns an extension of this encoding that explicitly stores
tetrahedron coordinates.

All other properties of the encoding will be copied across without
changes (including "theoretical" properties such as whether the
surface could have vertex linking components, or whether it could be
non-compact).

If this encoding already stores tetrahedron coordinates, then the
result will be identical to this.

    an extension of this encoding that stores tetrahedron coordinates.)doc";

The first letter of the returned string will be upper-case, and all
subsequent letters will be lower-case.

This routine is guaranteed to return a non-null string, even if
*coordSystem* is not one of the HyperCoords enum values.

Parameter ``coordSystem``:
    the coordinate system being queried; this may be any of the
