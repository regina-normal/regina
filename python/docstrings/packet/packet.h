// Docstring regina::python::doc::ChildIterator
static const char *ChildIterator =
R"doc(A forward iterator for iterating through all immediate children of a
given packet.

Each iterator will hold a std::shared_ptr to the packet whose children
it is iterating over. This guarantees that the packet will not be
destroyed mid-iteration, but it also means that you must ensure that
you dispose of your iterators once you are finished with them.

Template parameter ``const_``:
    Indicates whether this iterator should offer const or non-const
    access to the child packets.

Python:
    Instead of the C++ interface described here, in Python the classes
    PacketChildren and ChildIterator together implement the Python
    iterable/iterator interface. The class PacketChildren has just the
    single function ``__iter__()``, which returns a ChildIterator;
    then ChildIterator implements ``__next__()``, which either returns
    the next child packet in the iteration or else throws a
    ``StopException`` if there are no more children to return. All
    iteration in Python is non-const (i.e., Python exclusively uses
    the classes where *const_* is ``False``).)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Packet
static const char *Packet =
R"doc(Represents a packet of information that may be individually edited or
operated upon. Packets are stored in a tree structure, with
child/parent relationships; the root of the tree represents a complete
Regina data file.

There are two types of packets: _innate_ packets, and _wrapped_
packets.

* _Innate_ packets are only relevant within the context of a data
  file. Examples include containers (which are used to organise the
  packet tree), or scripts (which stores Python code with variables
  bound to other packets in the tree). Each innate packet type is
  represented by its own customised subclass of Packet (e.g.,
  Container or Script).

* _Wrapped_ packets hold some other type, which can also act as a
  standalone mathematical object. Examples include packets that hold
  triangulations, links, and normal surface lists. Each wrapped packet
  type is represented by a class of the form PacketOf<Held>, where
  *Held* is the underlying mathematical type (e.g., Triangulation<3>,
  Link, or NormalSurfaces).

Since Regina 7.0, packets are _always_ managed by std::shared_ptr.
There are _no_ exceptions to this rule. The implication of this are:

* Every new packet _must_ be wrapped in a std::shared_ptr immediately
  after construction. It is recommended that you create new packets
  using std::make_shared, not ``new``, so you do not forget this. Many
  of Regina's operations on packets will assume that such a
  std::shared_ptr exists, and will throw std::bad_weak_ptr exceptions
  if it does not.

* When given an existing raw packet pointer (e.g., as a function
  argument), you must _not_ wrap it in a new std::shared_ptr. This
  would lead to two shared pointers "independently" claiming ownership
  of the packet (which means the packet would be destroyed earlier
  than expected). If you need to convert a raw Packet* into a
  std::shared_ptr, you can use the member function shared_from_this()
  (inherited from std::enable_shared_from_this).

Parent packets own their children, but children do not own their
parents. This has the following impliciations for destruction:

* If you have a shared pointer to the root of the packet tree, then
  this will keep the entire packet tree alive.

* To destroy a child packet but not its parent, just call makeOrphan()
  on the child. This will remove the child from the tree, and then
  destroy the child once your last shared pointer to it goes out of
  scope.

* If you destroy a parent but you are also holding another shared
  pointer to one of its children, then that child will _not_ be
  destroyed. It will instead become orphaned, and will become the root
  of its own (smaller) packet tree.

The old Packet::safeDelete() function has been removed, since you
should not be manually destroying packets at all now (instead just
wait for the last std::shared_ptr to be destroyed).

There are different requirements when creating a new packet type.

To create a new innate packet type:

* Add a new type constant to the PacketType enum;

* Add corresponding cases to the routines in PacketInfo;

* Create a new subclass *C* of Packet, which begins with the
  REGINA_PACKET macro and implements all pure virtual functions
  (except for those already provided by REGINA_PACKET);

* Declare and implement a copy constructor, copy assignment operator,
  and member/global swap functions, whose arguments use the derived
  class *C* (not the base class Packet);

* Add an appropriate case to XMLPacketReader::startSubElement(), to
  support reading from file;

* For every routine in *C* that edits the packet contents, declare a
  Packet::ChangeEventSpan on the stack while the modification takes
  place so that listeners are notified (see the discussion below on
  event listeners).

To create a new wrapped packet type that holds an object of type
*Held:*

* Add a new type constant *T* to the PacketType enum;

* Add a specialisation of the template constant packetTypeHolds<Held>,
  which should take the value *T*;

* Add corresponding cases to the routines in PacketInfo;

* Add PacketData<Held> as a new base class for *Held* (this is very
  lightweight, just adding a single enum variable);

* Add specialisations that implement the routines in XMLWriter<Held>,
  to support writing to file;

* Add an appropriate case to XMLPacketReader::startSubElement(), to
  support reading from file;

* For every routine in *Held* that edits the packet contents, declare
  a Held::ChangeEventSpan on the stack while the modification takes
  place. This is again lightweight (if an object does not belong to a
  packet then the cost is just two integer comparisions), and it will
  ensure that if the object _does_ belong to a packet then listeners
  are notified.

External objects can listen for events on packets, such as when
packets are changed or about to be destroyed. This is useful (for
example) when keeping a graphical user interface in sync with any
changes that might be happening within the engine and/or via users'
python scripts. See the PacketListener class notes for details.

Regina's packet types do not support C++ move semantics, since this
would interfere with the structure of the packet tree. They do support
copy construction, copy assignment and swaps, but only in the derived
packet classes (e.g., you cannot assign from the polymorphic base
class Packet). Moreover, these operations only copy/swap the
mathematical content, not the packet infrastructure (e.g., they do not
touch packet labels, or the packet tree, or event listeners).)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::PacketChildren
static const char *PacketChildren =
R"doc(A lightweight object that gives access to all immediate children of a
given packet.

The purpose of this class is to support iteration through all children
of a packet *p* using range-based ``for`` loops:

In Python, PacketChildren is an iterable object:

```
parent = ...
for child in parent.children():

Each object of this class will hold a std::shared_ptr to the packet
whose children it gives access to. This guarantees that the packet
will not be destroyed during iteration, but it also means that you
must ensure that you dispose of these objects once you are finished
with them.

These are lightweight objects, small enough to pass by value and swap
with std::swap(), with no need for any specialised move operations or
swap functions. Copies of a PacketChildren will iterate over the
children of the same underlying packet.

// Docstring regina::python::doc::PacketData
static const char *PacketData =

connect with the wrapped packet class that contains it.

For every wrapped packet type of the form PacketOf<Held>, the
corresponding class *Held* must derive from PacketData<Held>. See the
Packet class notes for more information about packets, and for what
else must be implemented for each wrapped packet type.

This base class is extremely lightweight: the only data that it
contains is a single PacketHeldBy enumeration value. All of the class
constructors set this value to HELD_BY_NONE; it is the responsibility
of subclasses (e.g., PacketOf<Held>) to change this where necessary.

Python:
    Not present, but the routines anonID() and packet() will be
    provided directly through the various subclasses.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::PacketDescendants
static const char *PacketDescendants =
R"doc(A lightweight object that gives access to all strict descendants of a
given packet.

The purpose of this class is to support iteration through all strict
descendants of a packet *p* using range-based ``for`` loops:

```
std::shared_ptr<Packet> parent = ...;
for (Packet& desc : parent->descendants()) { ... }
```

In Python, PacketDescendants is an iterable object:

```
parent = ...
for desc in parent.descendants():
    ...

Each object of this class will hold a std::shared_ptr to the packet
whose descendants it gives access to. This guarantees that the packet
will not be destroyed during iteration, but it also means that you
must ensure that you dispose of these objects once you are finished

    Instead of the C++ interface described here, in Python the classes
    PacketDescendants and SubtreeIterator together implement the
    Python iterable/iterator interface. The class PacketDescendants
    has just the single function ``__iter__()``, which returns a
    SubtreeIterator; then SubtreeIterator implements ``__next__()``,
    which either returns the next descendant packet in the iteration
    or else throws a ``StopException`` if there are no more children
    to return. All iteration in Python is non-const (i.e., Python
    exclusively uses the classes where *const_* is ``False``).)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::PacketListener
static const char *PacketListener =
R"doc(An object that can be registered to listen for packet events.

A packet listener can be registered to listen for events on a packet
by calling Packet::listen().

Each time that one of the events listed in this class occurs, the
packet will call the appropriate callback routine for all registered
listeners.

These events come in future/past pairs: packetToBeChanged() and
packetWasChanged(), childToBeAdded() and childWasAdded(), and so on.
These event pairs are mutually exclusive: any event will cause at most
one pair of callback routines to be called for each (packet, listener)
pair. For instance, if a packet is renamed then packetToBeRenamed()
and packetWasRenamed() will be called but packetToBeChanged() and
packetWasChanged() will not.

As a special case, when a packet is destroyed there is only the one
event packetBeingDestroyed(), since this is called _during_ the packet
destructor (at a time when the set of listeners is still available,
but some of the other packet data may have already been destroyed).

No guarantees are made as to the order in which the different packet
listeners are notified of an event.

When a listener is destroyed, it is automatically unregistered from
any packets to which it is currently listening. Similarly, when a
packet is destroyed all listeners are automatically unregistered.

To listen for packet events using your own callback routines, you
would typically implement a subclass of PacketListener that overrides
only those callbacks that you are interested in. Be aware that:

* Callbacks are called for each listener, one at a time, in the same
  thread in which the event occurred.

* Callbacks can safely add new packet listeners, but there is no
  guarantee as to whether or not the new listeners will be notified of
  the specific event currently being processed.

* Callbacks can safely remove other listeners, but they must _not_
  remove the listener whose callback is currently being called. The
  one exception to this is packetBeingDestroyed(), which will
  explicitly remove each listener _before_ its callback is called
  (which means, for example, the listener can safely delete itself).

.. warning::
    Subclass authors should be aware of the default copy semantics
    that this base class provides. In particular, this base class
    provides a protected copy constructor and copy assignment operator
    that will change which packets are being listened to (in the
    "obvious" way). As a subclass author, you should understand this
    inherited behaviour if your subclass constructors and/or
    assignment operators use these base class operations implicitly.

.. warning::
    At the time of writing (admittedly long ago now), Qt has only
    limited support for multithreading. When working with an existing
    packet tree in a new thread (not the main thread), the _only_
    modification that you may make is to insert new packets.
    Modifications of any other type (such as changing, renaming,
    deleting or reordering existing packets) could lead to a crash
    within Qt or Xlib when running the GUI. Of course, a new thread
    may create, modify and delete its own temporary packet trees as it
    chooses (and it may in fact insert them into a pre-existing packet
    tree once all modifications are completed). Assuming these
    restrictions are respected, packet listeners may assume that no
    routines other than childWasAdded() will be called from a non-main
    thread.

Python:
    You can happily make a pure Python subclass of PacketListener, and
    packets will call whichever functions you override when events
    occur, just as they would for a native C++ subclass.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::PacketOf
static const char *PacketOf =
R"doc(A packet that stores a mathematical object of type *Held*.

This is the class used for all of Regina's _wrapped packet types_. See
the Packet class notes for general information about packets, and
about the differences between _wrapped_ and _innate_ packet types.

You can use a PacketOf<Held> in much the same way as you can use a
"raw" object of type *Held*. This class inherits the full interface
from *Held:* you can query and manipulate its objects in the same way,
and (using the std::in_place constructors) you can create them in the
same way also.

There are some important differences, however:

* The *Held* class will typically support full value semantics, with
  full support for copying, moving, and swapping (as is now common
  across most of Regina's API). In contrast, due the constraints of
  working with the packet tree, PacketOf<Held> objects are typically
  passed by pointer, copies and swaps do not touch the tree structure,
  and moves are not supported at all.

* The *Held* class will typically _not_ be polymorphic. In contrast,
  PacketOf<Held> aquires polymorphism through its inherited Packet
  interface.

Like all packet types, this class does not support C++ move semantics
since this would interfere with the structure of the packet tree. It
does support copy construction, copy assignment and swaps; however,
these operations only copy/swap the mathematical content, not the
packet infrastructure (e.g., they do not touch packet labels, or the
packet tree, or event listeners).

Python:
    Since Python does not support templates, this class will have a
    name of the form PacketOfHeld. For example, the C++ class Link is
    wrapped by the Python class ``PacketOfLink``, and the C++ class
    Triangulation<3> is wrapped by the Python class
    ``PacketOfTriangulation3``.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::PacketShell
static const char *PacketShell =
R"doc(Gives access to the final remains of a packet that is in the process
of being destroyed. The main use of this class is to pass packet
details to the callback function
PacketListener::packetBeingDestroyed().

All functions in this class mirror the corresponding Packet functions,
and are safe to call during PacketListener::packetBeingDestroyed().

This class works with raw Packet pointers, not std::shared_ptr,
because it typically only becomes relevant when a Packet is already in
the process of being destroyed (and so it is improper for a new shared
pointer to suddenly appear and try to claim ownership of the packet
again).

These are lightweight objects, small enough to pass by value and swap
with std::swap(), with no need for any specialised move operations or
swap functions. Copies of a PacketShell will give access to the

// Docstring regina::python::doc::SubtreeIterator
static const char *SubtreeIterator =
R"doc(A forward iterator for iterating through the entire packet subtree

The order of iteration is depth-first, where a parent packet is always
processed before its descendants.

Each iterator will hold a std::shared_ptr to the packet whose subtree
it is iterating over. This guarantees that the packet will not be
destroyed mid-iteration, but it also means that you must ensure that
you dispose of your iterators once you are finished with them.

By the time this function is called, we are already inside the Packet
destructor, and so most Packet member functions are no longer safe to
call. Therefore the argument that is passed to this routine is a
PacketShell, which exposes only those member functions of Packet that
are still safe to call at this time. Importantly, you can safely
compare a PacketShell against a Packet pointer, in case you need to
identify which particular packet is being destroyed.

When a packet is destroyed, it will automatically unregister each
listener _before_ calling packetBeingDestroyed() on that listener.
Therefore, for this (and only this) callback, it is safe for a
listener to unregister itself (since this will be a harmless operation
that does nothing). In particular, this makes it safe for a listener
to delete itself during this callback.

Subtree iteration is depth-first, where a parent packet is always

In Python, each packet can be treated as an iterable object, with the
effect of iterating through the corresponding subtree:

```
subtree = ...
for p in subtree:
    ...
```

Regina also supplies Python users with a member function
``Packet.subtree()``, which returns an iterable object. Iterating over
``Packet.subtree()`` is exactly the same as iterating the packet
itself; the ``subtree()`` function is offered because the intention
may be clearer for readers.

See also descendants() for iterating through just the strict

An adornment typically shows how a packet has been created and/or

"Summand #1".

The way in which the packet label is adorned depends upon the label
itself (in particular, an empty packet label will be handled in a
sensible way). The way in which the packet label is adorned is subject
to change in future versions of Regina.

Note that, whilst this routine returns a modified version of the
packet label, the label itself will not be permamently changed.

.. note::
    Since Regina 7.0, if a normal surface/hypersurface or angle
    structure list is cloned, then the new clone will refer back to
    the _original_ triangulation, even if we are cloning an entire

    original triangulation was cloned also (it could live outside the
    cloned subtree, or might not be part of a packet tree at all).

Parameter ``cloneDescendants``:
    ``True`` if the descendants of this packet should also be cloned

This routine is essentially a combination of makeOrphan() followed by
either prepend() or append().

Even if you are not holding a shared_ptr to this packet yourself, this
routine is still safe to use: it will maintain a shared_ptr as a
"guard" so that this packet is not inadvertently destroyed during the

This is exactly the same as testing whether the underlying Packet

Instead, this routine is designed for Python users, since:

* the Python keyword ``is`` will not work, because there could be many
  different Python wrappers all pointing to the same C++ object;

* the Python equality test (==) will not work, since as of Regina 7.0
  this compares objects by value (i.e., it tests whether their
  contents are equal).

A use case for this function could be (for example) iterating through
a packet tree and identifying when a particular known packet has been
found.

using Regina's native XML file format. The XML file may be optionally
compressed (Regina can happily read both compressed and uncompressed
XML).

This is the preferred way of saving a Regina data file. Typically this
will be called from the root of the packet tree, which will save the
entire packet tree to file.

Precondition:
    The given packet does not depend on its parent.

Internationalisation:
    This routine makes no assumptions about the character encoding
    used in the given file _name_, and simply passes it through
    unchanged to low-level C/C++ file I/O routines. The _contents_ of
    the file will be written using UTF-8.

Parameter ``filename``:
    the pathname of the file to write to.

Parameter ``compressed``:
    ``True`` if the XML data should be compressed, or ``False`` if it
    should be written as plain text.

Parameter ``format``:
    indicates which of Regina's XML file formats to write. You should
    use the default (REGINA_CURRENT_FILE_FORMAT) unless you need your
    file to be readable by older versions of Regina. This must not be
    REGINA_BINARY_GEN_1, which is no longer supported.

This is equivalent to calling reparent() on each child, but should be
somewhat faster if there are many children to move.

Even if you are not holding a shared_ptr to any of this packet's
children, this routine is still safe to use: it will ensure there is
always some shared_ptr to guard against any children being
inadvertently destroyed during the transfer.

and (ii) the XML will always be written in plain text (i.e., it will
not be compressed).

If you simply wish to save your data to a file on the filesystem, you
should call save() instead.

Typically this will be called from the root of the packet tree, which
