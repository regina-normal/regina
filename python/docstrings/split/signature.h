// Docstring regina::python::doc::Signature
static const char *Signature =
R"doc(Represents a signature of a splitting surface in a closed 3-manifold
triangulation.

A _splitting surface_ is (for these purposes) a compact normal surface
consisting of precisely one quad per tetrahedron and no other normal
(or almost normal) discs.

A _signature_ of order *n* is a string consisting of 2*n* letters
arranged into cycles, where *n* is the number of quads in the
splitting surface. From a signature, the corresponding splitting
surface and then the entire 3-manifold triangulation can be recreated.

A signature of order *n* uses the first *n* letters of the alphabet,
each precisely twice. Case is important; the meaning of a letter
changes according to whether it appears in upper-case or lower-case.

Each letter represents an individual quadrilateral (the two
occurrences of the letter representing the quadrilateral's two sides).
Each cycle represents a chain of quadrilaterals joined together in the
splitting surface. The case of a letter represents in which direction
a quadrilateral is traversed within a cycle.

Cycles are arranged into _cycle groups_, where a cycle group consists
of a series of consecutive cycles all of the same length.

An example of a signature is ``(abc)(a)(b)(c)``. This signature is of
order 3 and contains two cycle groups, the first being ``(abc)`` and
the second being ``(a)(b)(c)``.

A signature cannot represent a splitting surface with more than 26
quadrilaterals.

For further details on splitting surfaces and their signatures,
consult _Minimal triangulations and normal surfaces_, Burton, PhD
thesis, available from the Regina website.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.)doc";

valid signature.
