// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm
static const char *Perm =
R"doc(Represents a permutation of {0,1,2}. This is a specialisation of the
generic Perm template: it is highly optimised, and also offers some
additional functionality. Amongst other things, this permutation class
is used to specify how simplices of a 2-manifold triangulation are
glued together.

As with all Perm template classes, these objects are small enough to
pass by value and swap with std::swap(), with no need for any
specialised move operations or swap functions. Moreover, Perm<3> in
particular is extremely fast to work with.

Each permutation has an internal code, which is a single native
integer that is sufficient to reconstruct the permutation. Thus the
internal code may be a useful means for passing permutation objects to
and from the engine. For Perm<3>, the internal code is an integer
between 0 and 5 inclusive that gives the index of the permutation in
the array Perm<3>::S3. This is consistent with the second-generation
codes used in classes Perm<4>,...,Perm<7>.

To use this class, simply include the main permutation header
maths/perm.h.
