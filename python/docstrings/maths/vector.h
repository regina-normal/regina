// Docstring regina::python::doc::Vector
static const char *Vector =
R"doc(An optimised vector class of elements from a given ring T. Various
mathematical vector operations are available.

This class is intended for serious computation, and as a result it has
a streamlined implementation with no virtual methods. It can be
subclassed, but since there are no virtual methods, type information
must generally be known at compile time. Nevertheless, in many
respects, different subclasses of Vector<T> can happily interact with
one another.

This class is written with bulky types in mind (such as arbitrary
precision integers), and so creations and operations are kept to a
minimum.

As of Regina 7.0, this class explicitly supports zero-length vectors.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.

.. warning::
    As of Regina 4.90, this class merges the old functionality of
    NFastVector and the NVector hierarchy from Regina 4.6. As a side-
    effect, the hierarchy has been compressed into just one class
    (NVectorUnit, NVectorMatrix and NVectorDense are gone), elements
    are always stored as dense vectors, and functions are no longer
    virtual (since the storage model is now fixed). The virtual
    clone() method is gone completely (since there are no longer
    virtual functions you should use the copy constructor instead),
    and the old makeLinComb() method is also gone (just use operator
    *= and addCopies()).

Precondition:
    Type T has a copy constructor. That is, if ``a`` and ``b`` are of
    type T, then ``a`` can be initialised to the value of ``b`` using
    ``a(b)``.

Precondition:
    Type T has a default constructor. That is, an object of type T can
    be declared with no arguments. No specific default value is
    required.

Precondition:
    Type T allows for operators ``=``, ``==``, ``+=``, ``-=``, ``*=``,
    ``+``, ``-`` and ``*``.

Precondition:
    Type T has an integer constructor. That is, if ``a`` is of type T,
    then ``a`` can be initialised to an integer ``l`` using ``a(l)``.

Precondition:
    An element ``t`` of type T can be written to an output stream
    ``out`` using the standard expression ``out << t``.

Python:
    Only the specific types Vector<Integer> and Vector<LargeInteger>
    are available, under the names VectorInt and VectorLarge
    respectively.)doc";
