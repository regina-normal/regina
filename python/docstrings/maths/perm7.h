// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm
static const char *Perm =
R"doc(Represents a permutation of {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}. This is a specialisation
of the generic Perm template: it is highly optimised, and also offers
some additional functionality. Amongst other things, this permutation
class is used to specify how simplices of a 6-dimensional
triangulation are glued together.

As with all Perm template classes, these objects are small enough to
pass by value and swap with std::swap(), with no need for any
specialised move operations or swap functions.

Each permutation has an internal code, which is a single native
integer that is sufficient to reconstruct the permutation. Thus the
internal code may be a useful means for passing permutation objects to
and from the engine. For Perm<7>, the internal permutation codes have
changed as of Regina 7.0:

* _First-generation_ codes were used internally in Regina 6.0.1 and
  earlier. These are _image packs_: integers whose lowest three bits
  represent the image of 0, whose next lowest three bits represent the
  image of 1, and so on. The routines permCode1(), setPermCode1(),
  fromPermCode1() and isPermCode1() continue to work with first-
  generation codes for backward compatibility. Likewise, the XML data
  file format continues to use first-generation codes to describe
  gluings between 6-simplices.

* _Second-generation_ codes are used internally in Regina 7.0 and
  above. These codes are integers between 0 and 5039 inclusive,
  representing the index of the permutation in the array Perm<7>::S7.
  The routines permCode2(), setPermCode2(), fromPermCode2() and
  isPermCode2() work with second-generation codes.

It is highly recommended that, if you need to work with permutation
codes at all, you use second-generation codes where possible. This is
because the first-generation routines incur additional overhead in
converting back and forth between the second-generation codes (which
are used internally by Perm<7>).

To use this class, simply include the main permutation header
maths/perm.h.

The disadvantages of this routine are that (1) you must remember to

which involves significant computational overhead. If you need your
powers to be fast, you can instead:

* call precompute() to precompute a full 5040-by-5040 product table in
  advance (this will consume roughly 50MB of memory); and then

* call cachedPow() instead of pow() to make full use of this table,
  which will remove most of the overhead from this routine.

Parameter ``exp``:
    the exponent; this may be positive, zero or negative.

Returns:
    this permutation raised to the power of *exp*.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm_::pre
static const char *pre =
R"doc(Determines the preimage of the given integer under this permutation.

Parameter ``image``:
    the integer whose preimage we wish to find. This should be between
    0 and 6 inclusive.

Returns:
    the preimage of *image*.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm_::precompute
static const char *precompute =
R"doc(Performs the precomputation necessary for using the optimised
cachedComp(), cachedPow() and cachedOrder() routines.

This _must_ be called before calling any of cachedComp(), cachedPow()
or cachedOrder().

This only needs to be done once in the lifetime of the program. If you
do try to call precompute() a second time then it will do nothing and
return immediately.

This routine is thread-safe.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm_::rand
static const char *rand =
R"doc(Returns a random permutation on seven elements. All permutations are
returned with equal probability.

This routine is thread-safe, and uses RandomEngine for its random
number generation.

.. warning::
    This routine is expensive, since it locks and unlocks the mutex
    protecting Regina's global uniform random bit generator. If you
    are calling this many times in quick succession, consider creating
    a single RandomEngine object yourself and then calling
    ``rand(randomEngine.engine(), even)``.

Parameter ``even``:
    if ``True``, then the resulting permutation is guaranteed to be
    even (and again all even permutations are returned with equal
    probability).

Returns:
    a random permutation.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm_::reverse
static const char *reverse =
R"doc(Finds the reverse of this permutation.

Here _reverse_ means that we reverse the images of 0,...,6. In other
words, if permutation *q* is the reverse of *p*, then ``p[i] == q[6 -
i]`` for all *i*.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm_::rot
static const char *rot =
R"doc(Returns the *i*th rotation. This maps *k* to *k* + *i* (mod 7) for all
*k*.

Parameter ``i``:
    the image of 0; this must be between 0 and 6 inclusive.

    the *i*th rotation.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm_::setPermCode1
static const char *setPermCode1 =
R"doc(Sets this permutation to that represented by the given first-
generation permutation code.

Precondition:
    the given code is a valid first-generation permutation code; see
    isPermCode1() for details.

.. warning::
    This routine will incur additional overhead, since Perm<7> now
    uses second-generation codes internally. See the class notes and
    the routine setPermCode2() for details.

Parameter ``code``:
    the first-generation code that will determine the new value of
    this permutation.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm_::setPermCode2
static const char *setPermCode2 =
R"doc(Sets this permutation to that represented by the given second-
generation permutation code.

Second-generation codes are fast to work with, since they are used
internally by the Perm<7> class.

Precondition:
    the given code is a valid second-generation permutation code; see
    isPermCode2() for details.

Parameter ``code``:
    the second-generation code that will determine the new value of
    this permutation.)doc";

R"doc(Returns a string representation of this permutation. The
representation will consist of seven adjacent digits representing the
images of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively. An example of a string
representation is ``3045261``.

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm_::tightDecoding
static const char *tightDecoding =
R"doc(Reconstructs a permutation from its given tight encoding. See the page
on tight encodings for details.

The tight encoding will be given as a string. If this string contains
leading whitespace or any trailing characters at all (including
trailing whitespace), then it will be treated as an invalid encoding
(i.e., this routine will throw an exception).

Tight encodings are fast to work with for small permutation classes
(*n* â‰¤ 7), but slower for larger permutation classes (8 â‰¤ *n* â‰¤ 16).
See tightEncoding() for further details.

Exception ``InvalidArgument``:
    The given string is not a tight encoding of a 7-element
    permutation.

Parameter ``enc``:
    the tight encoding for a 7-element permutation.

Returns:
    the permutation represented by the given tight encoding.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm_::tightEncoding
static const char *tightEncoding =
R"doc(Returns the tight encoding of this permutation. See the page on tight
encodings for details.

For all permutation classes Perm<n>, the tight encoding is based on
the index into the full permutation group *S_n*. For smaller
permutation classes (*n* â‰¤ 7), such encodings are very fast to work
with since the *S_n* index is used as the internal permutation code.
For larger permutation classes however (8 â‰¤ *n* â‰¤ 16), the *S_n* index
requires some non-trivial work to compute.

Returns:
    the resulting encoded string.)doc";

    permutation.)doc";
