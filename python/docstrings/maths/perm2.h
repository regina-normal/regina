// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm
static const char *Perm =
R"doc(Represents a permutation of {0,1}. This is a specialisation of the
generic Perm template: it is highly optimised, but also somewhat
trivial (since there are only two possible permutations). It is
provided simply to optimise the general Perm<n> template for this
trivial case.

As with all Perm template classes, these objects are small enough to
pass by value and swap with std::swap(), with no need for any
specialised move operations or swap functions. Moreover, Perm<2> in
particular is extremely fast to work with.

Each permutation has an internal code, which is a single native
integer that is sufficient to reconstruct the permutation. Thus the
internal code may be a useful means for passing permutation objects to
and from the engine. For Perm<2>, the internal code is 0 for the
identity permutation, or 1 for the (unique) non-identity permutation.
This is consistent with the second-generation codes used in classes
Perm<4>,...,Perm<7>.

To use this class, simply include the main permutation header
maths/perm.h.

.. warning::
    Every permutation class Perm<n> provides a transposition (i.e.,
    pair swap) constructor ``Perm<n>(a,b).`` In addition, the
    specialised classes Perm<3>, Perm<4> and Perm<5> provide "list of
    images" constructors ``Perm<3>(a,b,c)``, ``Perm<4>(a,b,c,d)`` and
    ``Perm<5>(a,b,c,d,e)``. For Perm<2>, these two constructors would
    be indistinguishable (since both would take two integer
    arguments). Here Perm<2> takes an approach that is consistent with
    the generic Perm<n> class: ``Perm<2>(a,b)`` is interpreted as the
    _transposition_ of *a* and *b*. In particular, ``Perm(0,1)`` is
    _not_ the identity permutation.
