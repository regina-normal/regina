static const char *IntegerBase =
R"doc(Represents an arbitrary precision integer. Calculations are always
guaranteed to be exact, regardless of how large the integers become.

The current implementation uses fast native integer arithmetic
wherever possible, whilst always testing for potential overflow. If a
potential overflow is detected, this class switches to using the GNU
multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) instead.

This class takes a single boolean argument *supportInfinity*. If this
is ``True``, then this class will support infinity as an allowed
value. If this is ``False`` (the default), then infinity is not
supported, and any attempt to work with infinity will lead to
undefined behaviour. Supporting infinity is more flexible, but also
comes with a slight performance cost (very roughly estimated at around
10%-20%).

For the purposes of comparison, infinity is considered larger than any
other integer but equal to itself.

All routines in this class, including random number generation, are
thread-safe.

The opportunistic use of native arithmetic where possible was inspired
by the (much more complex and powerful) lazy exact arithmetic in CGAL.
Thanks to Menelaos Karavelas for encouraging me to take another look
at these ideas.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.

    Both variants of this template are available through Python. For
    *supportInfinity* = ``False``, use the name Integer. For
    *supportInfinity* = ``True``, use the name LargeInteger.)doc";
