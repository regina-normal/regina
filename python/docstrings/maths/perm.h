// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm
static const char *Perm =
R"doc(Represents a permutation of {0,1,...,*n*-1}. Amongst other things,
such permutations are used to describe simplex gluings in
(*n*-1)-manifold triangulations.

Perm objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with
std::swap(), with no need to use references, specialised move
operations or custom swap functions. The trade-off is that, for this
to be possible, the Perm template class can only work with *n* ≤ 16.

Each permutation has an internal code, which is a single native
integer that is sufficient to reconstruct the entire permutation. Thus
the internal code may be a useful means for passing permutation
objects to and from the engine. These codes are constructed as
follows:

* For 8 ≤ *n* ≤ 16, the code is an _image pack_: essentially a packed
  array that holds the images of 0,...,*n*-1 in a single native
  integer type. More precisely, this is an unsigned integer of type
  *ImagePack*, whose lowest *imageBits* bits represent the image of 0,
  whose next lowest *imageBits* bits represent the image of 1, and so
  on. This scheme is consistent with the old first-generation codes
  for *n* = 4,...,7, which are still supported but no longer used
  internally.

* For *n* ≤ 7, the code is an index into a hard-coded list of all
  possible permutations; more precisely, an index into the symmetric
  group Perm<n>::Sn. The ordering of Perm<n>::Sn is "almost
  lexicographic", in that we swap some pairs of indices (2*k*, 2*k*+1)
  to ensure that the even permutations are precisely those with even
  indices.

For *n* = 2,...,5 (which appear throughout 2-, 3- and 4-manifold
triangulations), this template is specialised: the code is highly
optimised and also offers some extra functionality. For *n* = 6,7,
this template is again specialised and highly optimised, and it offers
some extra functionality but not as much as Perm<5> and below. For *n*
≥ 8, this template is generic and most operations require more time
(in particular, there are no harded-coded lookup tables).

Python:
    Python does not support templates. For each *n* = 2,...,16, this
    class is available in Python under the corresponding name Perm2,
    Perm3, ..., Perm16.

Template parameter ``n``:
    the number of objects being permuted. This must be between 2 and
    16 inclusive.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::PermClass
static const char *PermClass =
R"doc(Represents a conjugacy class of permutations on *n* elements.

Each such conjugacy class correpsonds to an unordered partition of
*n*, describing the cycle structure of the permutations in the
conjugacy class.

There is a special "past-the-end" conjugacy class, which effectively
holds no value; the only way you can obtain such a class is to iterate
through *all* classes using the increment operators. You can test for
a past-the-end value by casting to ``bool``.

PermClass objects are, in their current implementation, entirely
stack-based. This means they cannot support fast move or swap
operations. However, their size is linear in *n*, so while copy
operations are not enormously expensive, they are not as cheap as
copying a Perm object (which just holds a single machine-native
integer). This decision is a deliberate trade-off between speed versus
space; the implication for end users is that you should be economical
about copying PermClass objects, and work with them in-place where
possible.

*n*-element permutation.

See the class notes for more information on image packs, and how they
are used to build permutation codes.

For *n* ≥ 8, this routine is identical to isPermCode().

Parameter ``pack``:
    the candidate image pack to test.

Returns:

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm_::isPermCode
static const char *isPermCode =
R"doc(Determines whether the given integer is a valid internal permutation
code. Valid permutation codes can be passed to setPermCode() or

Note that the largest possible order for the largest supported *n*
(*n* = 16) is 140. See OEIS sequence A000793 for details.

the index of this permutation in the Perm<n>::orderedSn array.

This routine runs in time linear in *n* (in particular, the running

cachedInverse() routine.

This _must_ be called before calling cachedInverse().

This only needs to be done once in the lifetime of the program. If you
do try to call precompute() a second time then it will do nothing and
return immediately.

The precomputed tables will consume roughly:

* 33 kB for *n* = 8;

* 8.9 MB for *n* = 9;

* 17 MB for *n* = 10;

* 143 MB for *n* = 11;

* 4.3 GB for *n* = 14;

* 37 GB for *n* = 15;

* 69 GB for *n* = 16.

In particular, a 32-bit machine will not be able to store these tables
for *n* ≥ 13, a 24-bit machine will not be these tables for *n* ≥ 9,
and a 16-bit machine will not be able to store these tables for any
*n* ≥ 8.

Precondition:
    There is enough memory available to store the precomputed tables;
    see above for the estimated space requirements.

Exception ``FailedPrecondition``:

    tables.

static const char *rand =
R"doc(Returns a random permutation on *n* elements. All permutations are
returned with equal probability.

This routine is thread-safe, and uses RandomEngine for its random
number generation.

.. warning::
    This routine is expensive, since it locks and unlocks the mutex
    protecting Regina's global uniform random bit generator. If you
    are calling this many times in quick succession, consider creating
    a single RandomEngine object yourself and then calling
    ``rand(randomEngine.engine(), even)``.

Parameter ``even``:
    if ``True``, then the resulting permutation is guaranteed to be
    even (and again all even permutations are returned with equal
    probability).

Returns:
    a random permutation.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm_::reverse
static const char *reverse =
R"doc(Finds the reverse of this permutation.

hexadecimal digits will be used.

An example of a string representation for *n* = 5 is ``30421``.

static const char *tightDecoding =
R"doc(Reconstructs a permutation from its given tight encoding. See the page
on tight encodings for details.

The tight encoding will be given as a string. If this string contains
leading whitespace or any trailing characters at all (including
trailing whitespace), then it will be treated as an invalid encoding
(i.e., this routine will throw an exception).

Tight encodings are fast to work with for small permutation classes
(*n* ≤ 7), but slower for larger permutation classes (8 ≤ *n* ≤ 16).
See tightEncoding() for further details.

Exception ``InvalidArgument``:
    The given string is not a tight encoding of an *n*-element
    permutation.

Parameter ``enc``:
    the tight encoding for an *n*-element permutation.

Returns:
    the permutation represented by the given tight encoding.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Perm_::tightEncoding
static const char *tightEncoding =
R"doc(Returns the tight encoding of this permutation. See the page on tight
encodings for details.

For all permutation classes Perm<n>, the tight encoding is based on
the index into the full permutation group *S_n*. For smaller
permutation classes (*n* ≤ 7), such encodings are very fast to work
with since the *S_n* index is used as the internal permutation code.
For larger permutation classes however (8 ≤ *n* ≤ 16), the *S_n* index
requires some non-trivial work to compute.

Returns:
    the resulting encoded string.)doc";
