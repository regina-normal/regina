// Docstring regina::python::doc::Rational
static const char *Rational =
R"doc(Represents an arbitrary precision rational number. Calculations with
Rational objects will be exact.

Infinity (1/0) and undefined (0/0) are catered for. (-1/0) is
considered the same as (1/0), and is represented as (1/0). Any
operation involving (0/0) will return (0/0).

Since infinity is the same as negative infinity, both infinity plus
infinity and infinity minus infinity will return infinity. Infinity
divided by infinity returns undefined, as does infinity times zero.

For the purposes of ordering, undefined is the smallest rational and
infinity is the largest. Undefined is always equal to itself, and
infinity is always equal to itself.

When performing computations on rationals, the results will always be
stored in lowest terms (i.e., with relatively prime numerator and
denominator), and with a non-negative denominator. However, when
constructing a rational number from scratch (e.g., by supplying the
numerator and denominator separately), it is your responsibility to
ensure that the rational is in lowest terms.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.)doc";
