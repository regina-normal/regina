To use this class: create a new Base64SigDecoder by passing details of
the encoded string to its constructor, and then call its
``decode...()`` member functions to read values sequentially from the
encoding.

This class will keep track of a current position in the encoded
string. Each call to a ``decode...()`` member function will advance
this position accordingly (but never beyond the end of the string).

This base64 encoding uses the characters: ``a..zA..Z0..9+-``

Baes64 decoders are single-use objects: they cannot be copied, moved
or swapped.

    not be a problem: Regina uses this encoding exclusively for
    signatures, and uses utilities/base64.h exclusively for encoding
    files.
