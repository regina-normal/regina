// Docstring regina::python::doc::Bitmask
static const char *Bitmask =
R"doc(A bitmask that can store arbitrarily many true-or-false bits.

This bitmask packs the bits together, so that (unlike an array of
bools) many bits can be stored in a single byte. As a result,
operations on this class are fast because the CPU can work on many
bits simultaneously.

Nevertheless, this class still has overhead because the bits must be
allocated on the heap, and because every operation requires looping
through the individual bytes. For reasonably small bitmasks, see the
highly optimised Bitmask1 and Bitmask2 classes instead.

Once a bitmask is created, the only way its length (the number of
bits) can be changed is by calling reset(size_t).

The length of the bitmask is not actually stored in this structure.
This means that, upon construction (or reset), the length will be
automatically rounded up to the next "raw unit of storage".

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.

.. warning::
    Because this class may increase the length of the bitmask
    (rounding up to the next unit of storage), bitwise computations
    may not give the results that you expect. In particular, flip()
    may set additional ``True`` bits in the "dead space" between the
    intended length and the actual length, and this may have a flow-on
    effect for other operations (such as subset testing, bit counting
    and so on). Be careful!)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Bitmask1
static const char *Bitmask1 =
R"doc(A small but extremely fast bitmask class that can store up to 8 *
sizeof(*T*) true-or-false bits.

This bitmask packs all of the bits together into a single variable of
type *T*. This means that operations on bitmasks are extremely fast,
because all of the bits can be processed at once.

The downside of course is that the number of bits that can be stored
is limited to 8 * sizeof(*T*), where *T* must be a native unsigned
integer type (such as unsigned char, unsigned int, or unsigned long
long).

For another extremely fast bitmask class that can store twice as many
bits, see Bitmask2. For a bitmask class that can store arbitrarily
many bits, see Bitmask.

These objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with
std::swap(), with no need for any specialised move operations or swap
functions.

Precondition:
    Type *T* is an unsigned integral numeric type.

Python:
    Python does not support templates, and so instead Regina's python
    interface offers the classes Bitmask8, Bitmask16, Bitmask32,
    Bitmask64, Bitmask128, and (if the machine supports 128-bit
    integers) Bitmask256. Each of these will be an optimised bitmask
    class that can hold the corresponding number of bits, and is
    guaranteed to be an instance of either the C++ Bitmask1<T> class
    (where possible) or the C++ Bitmask2<T,U> template class (if
    necessary).)doc";

static const char *Bitmask2 =
R"doc(A small but extremely fast bitmask class that can store up to 8 *
sizeof(*T*) + 8 * sizeof(*U*) true-or-false bits.

This bitmask packs all of the bits together into a single variable of
type *T* and a single variable of type *U*. This means that operations
on entire bitmasks are extremely fast, because all of the bits can be
processed in just two "native" operations.

The downside of course is that the number of bits that can be stored
is limited to 8 * sizeof(*T*) + 8 * sizeof(*U*), where *T* and *U*
must be native unsigned integer types (such as unsigned char, unsigned
int, or unsigned long long).

bits, see Bitmask1. For a bitmask class that can store arbitrarily
many bits, see Bitmask.

.. warning::
    As explain in the class notes, bitmasks do not store their exact

    different lengths may still be considered equal if the two lengths

This is a convenience routine for setting many bits at once. The
indices of the bits to set should be sorted and stored in some
container, such as a std::set or a C-style array. This routine takes
iterators over this container, and sets the bits at the corresponding
indices to the given value.

For example, the following code would set bits 3, 5 and 6 to ``true:``

```
std::vector<unsigned> indices;
indices.push(3); indices.push(5); indices.push(6);
bitmask.set(indices.begin(), indices.end(), true);
```

Likewise, the following code would set bits 1, 4 and 7 to ``false:``

```
unsigned indices[3] = { 1, 4, 7 };
bitmask.set(indices, indices + 3, false);
```

All other bits of this bitmask are unaffected by this routine.

Precondition:
    *ForwardIterator* is a forward iterator type that iterates over
    integer values.

Precondition:
    The list of indices described by these iterators is in _sorted_
    order. This is to allow optimisations for larger bitmask types.

Precondition:
    All indices in the given list are at least zero and strictly less
    than the length of this bitmask.

Python:
    Instead of a pair of iterators, you should pass a Python list
    (which, as described above, must be a sorted list of indices).

Parameter ``indexBegin``:
    the beginning of the iterator range containing the sorted indices
    of the bits to set.

Parameter ``indexEnd``:
    the end of the iterator range containing the sorted indices of the
    bits to set.
