// Docstring regina::python::doc::BlockedSFSLoop
static const char *BlockedSFSLoop =
R"doc(Represents a blocked Seifert fibred space with two boundary tori that
are joined together. This is a particular type of triangulation of a
graph manifold, formed from a single saturated region whose two torus
boundaries are identified. An optional layering may be placed between
the two torus boundaries to allow for a more interesting relationship
between the two sets of boundary curves. For more detail on saturated
regions and their constituent saturated blocks, see the SatRegion
class; for more detail on layerings, see the Layering class.

The saturated region may have two boundary components formed from one
saturated annulus each. Alternatively, it may have one boundary formed
from two saturated annuli, where this boundary is pinched together so
that each annulus becomes a two-sided torus (both of which are later
joined together). None of the boundary components (or the two-sided
tori discussed above) may be twisted (i.e., they must be tori, not
Klein bottles).

The way in which the two torus boundaries are identified is specified
by a 2-by-2 matrix, which expresses curves representing the fibres and
base orbifold on the second boundary in terms of such curves on the
first boundary (see the page on notation for Seifert fibred spaces for
terminology).

More specifically, suppose that *f0* and *o0* are directed curves on
the first boundary torus and *f1* and *o1* are directed curves on the
second boundary torus, where *f0* and *f1* represent the fibres of the
region and *o0* and *o1* represent the base orbifold. Then the
boundaries are joined according to the following relation:

```
    [f1]       [f0]
    [  ] = M * [  ]
    [o1]       [o0]
```

If a layering is present between the two torus boundaries, then the
corresponding boundary curves are not identified directly. In this
case, the matrix *M* shows how the layering relates the curves on each
boundary.

Note that the routines writeName() and writeTeXName() do _not_ offer
enough information to uniquely identify the triangulation, since this
essentially requires 2-dimensional assemblings of saturated blocks.
For full details, writeTextLong() may be used instead.

The optional StandardTriangulation routine manifold() is implemented
for this class, but homology() is not.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value. Note,
however, that the only way to create objects of this class (aside from
copying or moving) is via the static member function recognise().)doc";

have the same combinatorial parameters (which for this subclass is
more specific than combinatorial isomorphism, since this test does not
account for the many symmetries in a blocked Seifert fibred space).
