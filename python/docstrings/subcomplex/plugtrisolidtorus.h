// Docstring regina::python::doc::PlugTriSolidTorus
static const char *PlugTriSolidTorus =
R"doc(Represents a plugged triangular solid torus component of a
triangulation. Such a component is obtained as follows.

Begin with a three-tetrahedron triangular solid torus (as described by
class TriSolidTorus). Observe that the three axis edges divide the
boundary into three annuli.

To each of these annuli a layered chain may be optionally attached. If
present, the chain should be attached so its hinge edges are
identified with the axis edges of the corresonding annulus and its
bottom tetrahedron is layered over either the major edge or minor edge
of the corresponding annulus. The top two triangular faces of the
layered chain should remain free.

Thus we now have three annuli on the boundary, each represented as a
square two of whose (opposite) edges are axis edges of the original
triangular solid torus (and possibly also hinge edges of a layered
chain).

Create a _plug_ by gluing two tetrahedra together along a single
triangle. The six edges that do not run along this common triangle
split the plug boundary into three squares. These three squares must
be glued to the three boundary annuli previously described. Each axis
edge meets two of the annuli; the two corresponding edges of the plug
must be non-adjacent (have no common vertex) on the plug. In this way
each of the six edges of the plug not running along its interior
triangle corresponds to precisely one of the two instances of
precisely one of the three axis edges.

If the axis edges are directed so that they all point the same way
around the triangular solid torus, these axis edges when drawn on the
plug must all point from one common tip of the plug to the other
(where the _tips_ of the plug are the vertices not meeting the
interior triangle). The gluings must also be made so that the
resulting triangulation component is orientable.

Of the optional StandardTriangulation routines, manifold() is
implemented for most plugged triangular solid tori and homology() is
not implemented at all.

This class supports copying but does not implement separate move
operations, since its internal data is so small that copying is just
as efficient. It implements the C++ Swappable requirement via its own
member and global swap() functions, for consistency with the other
StandardTriangulation subclasses. Note that the only way to create
these objects (aside from copying or moving) is via the static member
function recognise().)doc";

Specifically, two structures will compare as equal if and only if
their equators are of the same (major/minor) type, and the same
numbered annuli either both have no chains attached or both have
chains of the same length attached in the same (major/minor) manner.

This test follows the general rule for most subclasses of

and TriSolidTorus): two objects compare as equal if and only if they
have the same combinatorial parameters (which for this subclass is
more specific than combinatorial isomorphism, since this test does not
account for the many symmetries in a plugged triangular solid torus).

can be carried up to the annuli at the top of each layered chain; the

the equator of the plug.
