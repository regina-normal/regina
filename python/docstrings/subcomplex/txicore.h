// Docstring regina::python::doc::TxICore
static const char *TxICore =
R"doc(Provides a triangulation of the product ``T x I`` (the product of the
torus and the interval). Generally these triangulations are only one
tetrahedron thick (i.e., a "thin I-bundle"), though this is not a
strict requirement of this class. Triangulations of this type are
generally used as components of larger triangulations (such as layered
surface bundles).

This product has two torus boundaries, called the *upper* and *lower*
boundaries. Each of these boundary tori must be formed from precisely
two triangles. This class tracks the mappings between parallel curves
on the upper and lower boundaries, as well as mappings from boundary
curves to specific tetrahedron edges.

For each of the two torus boundaries, two curves are chosen as
generators of the fundamental group; these curves are called α and β.
Note that there is no requirement that the upper α and β be parallel
to the lower α and β. The parallelReln() routine can be called to
establish the precise relationship between these upper and lower
curves.

Every object of this class contains a full copy of the triangulation
that it describes (so you should not create excessive objects of this
class without reason). This triangulation can be accessed through the
core() routine.

This is an abstract base class; however, the concrete subclasses offer
all of the usual copy, move and swap operations. See each subclass for
details.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::TxIDiagonalCore
static const char *TxIDiagonalCore =
R"doc(One of a family of thin ``T x I`` triangulations that typically appear
at the centres of layered torus bundles. Different triangulations in
this family use different numbers of tetrahedra, with the larger
triangulations producing more complicated relationships between the
upper and lower boundary curves.

Members of this family are parameterised by their size (the number of
tetrahedra) and an additional integer *k*, where 1 ≤ *k* ≤ *size* - 5.
Note that this means we must have *size* ≥ 6. The member of this
family of size *n* with additional parameter *k* is labelled
``T_n:k``.

It is worth noting that ``T_n:k`` is isomorphic to ``T_n:(n-4-k)``, so
in reality there are only [(*n*-4)/2] different triangulations for a
given size (rounded down).

A triangulation of this family is most easily defined in terms of its
central torus. Central surfaces are described in detail in "Structures
of small closed non-orientable 3-manifold triangulations", Benjamin A.
Burton, J. Knot Theory Ramifications 16 (2007), 545--574; in
particular, see the section on thin I-bundles.

The central torus begins with two triangles *u0* and *u1* (which
eventually provide the upper torus boundary), with a chain of
quadrilaterals *q1*, ..., *q*(*n*-5) descending diagonally beneath
them as illustrated in the diagram below.

(Image available in HTML docs)

We then distort quadrilateral *qk* and attach two more triangles *w0*
and *w1* to its side (these will eventually provide the lower torus
boundary). This is illustrated in the following diagram.

(Image available in HTML docs)

The entire central torus wraps from left to right (so the lower left
edges of most quadrilaterals *qi* are identified with the upper right
edges of *q*(*i*-1), and the left edge of *qk* is identified with the
right edge of *w1*). As an exception, the two uppermost edges are
identified with the two lowermost edges in a parallel fashion (so the
upper left edge of *u1* is identified with the lower right edge of
*q1*, and the adjacent edges at right angles to these are also
identified).

The four triangles in the central torus correspond to the four
tetrahedra in the triangulation that provide the boundary triangles.
The upper boundary is coned out from triangles *u0* and *u1*, and the
lower boundary is coned out from triangles *w0* and *w1*. In each
boundary, *u0* or *w0* gives the first boundary triangle and *u1* or
*w1* gives the second. The directions of the corresponding α and β
curves are illustrated below.

As a final illustration, the example below shows the central surface
in the case (*n*, *k*) = (9, 2).

R"doc(A specific six-tetrahedron TxICore triangulation that does not fit
neatly into other families.

This triangulation contains the fewest possible number of tetrahedra
(TxICore triangulations are not seen below six tetrahedra). It is
referred to as ``T_6¹`` in the paper "Structures of small closed non-
orientable 3-manifold triangulations", Benjamin A. Burton, J. Knot
Theory Ramifications 16 (2007), 545--574. In Regina it is given the
name ``T_6*``, to avoid confusion with the different TxIDiagonalCore
triangulation ``T_6:1``.

The triangulations of the upper and lower boundary tori are completely
parallel (and in particular, the upper and lower α curves are
parallel, as are the upper and lower β curves).

For reference, the central torus of this triangulation is depicted
below. The left and right sides of the diagram are identified, as are
the top and bottom. The four triangles *u0*, *u1*, *w0* and *w1*
provide the boundary triangles of the overall triangulation, with the
upper boundary coned out from triangles *u0* and *u1* and the lower
boundary coned out from triangles *w0* and *w1*. In each boundary,
*u0* or *w0* gives the first boundary triangle and *u1* or *w1* gives
the second. The directions of the corresponding α and β curves are are
also included.

edges 0-2 or 0-1. The important observations are that edges 1-2 and

real tetrahedron vertices. Let *t* be the tetrahedron returned by
bdryTet(*whichBdry*, *whichTri*) and let *p* be the permutation
returned by bdryRoles(*whichBdry*, *whichTri*). Then vertices *p*[0],
*p*[1] and *p*[2] of tetrahedron *t* correspond to the markings 0, 1

triangle is face *p*[3] of the tetrahedron).
