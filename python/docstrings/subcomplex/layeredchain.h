// Docstring regina::python::doc::LayeredChain
static const char *LayeredChain =
R"doc(Represents a layered chain in a triangulation.

A layered chain is a set of *n* tetrahedra glued to each other by
layerings. For each tetrahedron, select two top faces, two bottom
faces and two hinge edges, so that the top faces are adjacent, the
bottom faces are adjacent, the hinge edges are opposite and each hinge
meets both a top and a bottom face. The tetrahedron can thus be
thought of as a fattened square with the top and bottom faces above
and below the square respectively, and the hinges as the top and
bottom edges of the square. The left and right edges of the square are
identified to form an annulus.

For each *i*, the top faces of tetrahedron *i* are glued to the bottom
faces of tetrahedron *i*+1. This is done by layering the upper
tetrahedron upon the annulus formed by the top faces of the lower
tetrahedron. The layering should be done over the left or right edge
of the lower square (note that these two edges are actually
identified). The top hinges of each tetrahedron should be identified,
as should the bottom hinges.

The bottom faces of the first tetrahedron and the top faces of the
last tetrahedron form the boundary of the layered chain. If there is
more than one tetrahedron, the layered chain forms a solid torus with
two vertices whose axis is parallel to each hinge edge.

The *index* of the layered chain is the number of tetrahedra it
contains. A layered chain must contain at least one tetrahedron.

Note that for the purposes of manifold() and homology(), a layered
chain containing only one tetrahedron will be considered as a
standalone tetrahedron that forms a 3-ball (and not a solid torus).

All optional StandardTriangulation routines are implemented for this
class.

This class supports copying but does not implement separate move
operations, since its internal data is so small that copying is just
as efficient. It implements the C++ Swappable requirement via its own
member and global swap() functions, for consistency with the other
StandardTriangulation subclasses.)doc";
