// Docstring regina::python::doc::SatBlock
static const char *SatBlock =
R"doc(Represents a saturated block in a Seifert fibred space. A saturated
block is a connected set of tetrahedra built from a subset of fibres
(no fibres may enter or exit the boundary of the block). In addition,
the boundary of this block must be a ring of saturated annuli, as
described by the SatAnnulus class. Aside from this ring of saturated
annuli, there may be no other boundary triangles within the block.

The boundary annuli are numbered consecutively as illustrated below,
where the markings 0 and 1 within the triangles represent the first
and second triangle of each annulus (see the SatAnnulus class notes
for details). Note that the following diagram is viewed from _inside_
the block.

```
              -+---+---+---+---+---+---+-
               |0 /|0 /|0 /|0 /|0 /|0 /|
           ... | / | / | / | / | / | / | ...
               |/ 1|/ 1|/ 1|/ 1|/ 1|/ 1|
              -+---+---+---+---+---+---+-
Annulus #  ...  n-2 n-1  0   1   2   3   ...
```

The ring of boundary annuli may optionally be twisted, so that
together the annuli form a long Mobius band. In this case, for the
purposes of labelling and marking annuli, the twist occurs between
annuli n-1 and 0. Be careful when dealing with blocks with twisted
boundaries, since with twists it is possible to identify an edge with
itself in reverse (thus producing something that is not a 3-manifold
triangulation).

Each saturated block corresponds to a piece of the base orbifold of
the larger Seifert fibred space. For the purpose of connecting the
base orbifold together, we assume that the boundary of this particular
piece runs horizontally in the diagram above (specifically following
the horizontal edges of the boundary annuli, as described in the
SatAnnulus class notes). Insisting on such a boundary may lead to
(1,*k*) twists within the block; these are accounted for by the
virtual adjustSFS() routine.

Saturated blocks are generally joined to one another (or themselves)
along their boundary annuli. For this purpose, each saturated block
contains a list of which annulus of this block is adjacent to which
annulus of which other block. Adjacencies may be _reflected_, meaning
that the adjacent annulus has its fibres reversed (i.e., the adjacent
annulus has undergone an up-to-down reflection); they may also be
_backwards_, meaning that the first triangle of one annulus is joined
to the second triangle of the other (and vice versa).

This is an abstract base class: its subclasses correspond to different
combinatorial constructions (or in some cases, parameterised families
of constructions). Each subclass of SatBlock:

* must override all pure virtual functions (of course);

* should override transform() if the subclass contains additional data
  that needs to be altered when an isomorphism is applied;

* should not override writeTextLong(), since SatBlock uses short
  output only.

SatBlock does not support value semantics: blocks cannot be copied,
swapped, or manually constructed. Their memory is managed by the
SatRegion class (or in special cases the SatBlockModel class), and
their locations in memory define them. See SatRegion for further
details.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::SatBlock_::adjustSFS
static const char *adjustSFS =
R"doc(Adjusts the given Seifert fibred space to insert the contents of this

an ordinary solid torus (base orbifold a disc, no twists or
exceptional fibres) had been replaced by this block. This description
does not make sense for blocks with twisted boundary; the twisted case
is discussed below.

If the argument *reflect* is ``True``, it should be assumed that this
saturated block is being reflected before being inserted into the
larger Seifert fibred space. That is, any twists or exceptional fibres
should be negated before being added.

Regarding the signs of exceptional fibres: Consider a saturated block
containing a solid torus whose meridinal curve runs *p* times
horizontally around the boundary in order through annuli 0,1,... and
follows the fibres *q* times from bottom to top (as depicted in the
diagram in the SatBlock class notes). Then this saturated block adds a
positive (*p*, *q*) fibre to the underlying Seifert fibred space.

If the ring of saturated annuli bounding this block is twisted then
the situation becomes more complex. It can be proven that such a block
must contain a twisted reflector boundary in the base orbifold (use
Z_2 homology with fibre-reversing paths to show that the base orbifold
must contain another twisted boundary component, and then recall that
real boundaries are not allowed inside blocks).

In this twisted boundary case, it should be assumed that the twisted
reflector boundary is already stored in the given Seifert fibred
space. This routine should make any further changes that are required
(there may well be none). That is, the space should be adjusted as
though a trivial Seifert fibred space over the annulus with one
twisted reflector boundary (and one twisted puncture corresponding to
the block boundary) had been replaced by this block. In particular,
this routine should _not_ add the reflector boundary itself.

Parameter ``sfs``:
    the Seifert fibred space to adjust.

    ``True`` if this block is to be reflected, or ``False`` if it
    should be inserted directly.)doc";

    listed, or ``False`` otherwise.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::SatBlock_::nextBoundaryAnnulus
static const char *nextBoundaryAnnulus =
R"doc(Finds the next (or previous) boundary annulus around from this,
treating all adjacent blocks as part of a single large saturated
region.

Suppose that all saturated blocks are merged together according to
adjacent boundary annuli, forming larger saturated structures. The
remaining annuli that do not have adjacent blocks will group together
to form several large boundary rings. Note that each boundary ring
might involve annuli from several different blocks, and might or might
not have a twist (thus forming a large Klein bottle instead of a large
torus).

This routine is used to trace around such a boundary ring. It is
assumed that annulus *thisAnnulus* of this block forms part of a
boundary ring (i.e., it has no adjacent block). This routine will then
return the next/previous annulus around from this in the large
boundary ring. Here "next" means in the direction following from the
second triangle of this annulus, and "previous" means in the direction
following from the first triangle; the boolean argument *followPrev*
controls which we will be used. This next/previous annulus might
belong to another block, or it might even be this original annulus
again.

The next/previous annulus itself is not returned, but rather a
reference as to how it appears within its enclosing saturated block.
Specifically, a block and corresponding annulus number will be
included as the first two elements of the returned tuple.

It is possible that the next/previous annulus as it appears within the
returned block is oriented differently from how it appears within this
large boundary ring. For this reason, two booleans are returned also.
The third element of the returned tuple will describe whether the
annulus is reflected vertically as it appears within the large
boundary ring (i.e., the first and second triangles remain the same
but the fibre direction is reversed). Similarly, the fourth element of
the tuple will describe whether the annulus is reflected horizontally
as it appears within the large boundary ring (i.e., first and second
triangles are switched but the fibre direction is unchanged).

It is possible that both a horizontal and vertical reflection take
place. Note that any kind of reflection will also affect the locations
of the 0/1/2 markings as described in the SatAnnulus class notes.

Finally, note that if the large boundary ring is twisted (i.e., it
forms a Klein bottle), then following the entire boundary ring around
using this routine will bring you back to the starting annulus but
with the vertical reflection flag set.

Precondition:
    Annulus *thisAnnulus* of this block has no block adjacent to it.

.. warning::
    If you wish to trace around an entire boundary ring, you will need
    to adjust the argument *followPrev* according to whether or not
    the current annulus is reflected horizontally (since, under a
    horizontal reflection, "next" becomes "previous" and vice versa).

Parameter ``thisAnnulus``:
    describes which original boundary annulus of this block to
    examine; this must be between 0 and countAnnuli()-1 inclusive.

Parameter ``followPrev``:
    ``True`` if we should find the previous boundary annulus, or
    ``False`` if we should find the next boundary annulus.

Returns:
    a tuple (*nextBlock*, *nextAnnulus*, *refVert*, *refHoriz*),
    where: *nextBlock* is the block containing the next boundary
    annulus around from *thisAnnulus*; *nextAnnulus* is the specific
    annulus number within *nextBlock* of the next annulus around
    (between 0 and *nextBlock*->countAnnuli()-1 inclusive, and the
    corresponding annulus will have no block adjacent to it);
    *refVert* is ``True`` iff the next annulus around is vertically
    reflected; and *refHoriz* is ``True`` iff the next annulus around
    is horizontally reflected (see above for details on reflections).)doc";
