// Docstring regina::python::doc::GluingPerms
constexpr const char *GluingPerms =
R"doc(Represents a specific set of gluing permutations to complement a
particular pairwise matching of simplex facets. Given a pairwise
matching of facets (as described by class FacetPairing<dim>), each
facet that is matched with some other facet will have an associated
permutation of (*dim* + 1) elements.

If a facet is matched with some other facet, the two associated
permutations in this set will be inverses. If a facet is left
deliberately unmatched, it will have no associated permutation in this
set.

Such a set of permutations models part of the structure of a
triangulation, in which each simplex facet that is glued to another
facet has a corresponding gluing permutation (and the matched facet
has the inverse gluing permutation).

The main purpose of this class is to provide a way of quickly
describing and manipulating the combinatorial structure of a
triangulation without the overhead of a full-blown Triangulation<dim>
object. In particular, this class was designed for use in census
enumeration, which involves rapid construction and editing of these
permutations. To convert this into a full Triangulation<dim> object,
you can call triangulate().

Internally, this class stores each permutation as an index into
Perm<dim+1>::Sn_1 (that is, an index into the permutation group
*S_dim*). Importantly, you can only _set_ permutations using these
indices, via the non-const permIndex() function - access to the
permutations themselves is read-only. You can use indexToGluing() and
gluingToIndex() to convert between indicex and permutations, or you
can use the read-only member function perm() which returns the
permutation directly. Note that this correspondence is non-trivial,
and depends on the details of the underlying facet pairing.

This class also supports a special "not yet chosen" permutation,
represented using the permutation index -1. Attempting to convert this
to a real permutation using perm() or indexToGluing() is not allowed,
and will result in undefined behaviour.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.

    the dimension of the underlying triangulation that is being
    modelled. This must be between 2 and 15 inclusive.)doc";
