This is a specialisation of the generic Triangulation class template;
see the generic Triangulation documentation for a general overview of
how the triangulation classes work. In Python, you can read this
generic documentation by looking at a higher dimension: try
``help(Triangulation5)``.

This 2-dimensional specialisation offers significant extra
functionality, including many functions specific to 2-manifolds.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.)doc";

This will also clone any computed properties (such as homology,
fundamental group, and so on), as well as the skeleton (vertices,
edges, components, etc.). In particular, the same numbering and
labelling will be used for all skeletal objects.

If *src* has any locks on top-dimensional simplices and/or their
facets, these locks will also be copied across.

If you want a "clean" copy that resets all properties to unknown and
leaves the skeleton uncomputed, you can use the two-argument copy
constructor instead.

whether or not to clone its computed properties also.

If *cloneProps* is ``True``, then this constructor will also clone any
computed properties (such as homology, fundamental group, and so on),
as well as the skeleton (vertices, edges, components, etc.). In
particular, the same numbering and labelling will be used for all
skeletal objects in both triangulations.

If *cloneProps* is ``False``, then these properties and skeletal
objects will be marked as unknown in the new triangulation, and will
be recomputed on demand if/when they are required. Note in particular
that, when the skeleton is recomputed, there is no guarantee that the
numbering and labelling for skeletal objects will be the same as in
the source triangulation.

If *src* has any locks on top-dimensional simplices and/or their
facets, these locks will be copied across _only_ if *cloneProps* is
``True``. If *cloneProps* is ``False`` then the new triangulation will
have no locks at all.

Parameter ``src``:
    the triangulation to copy.

Parameter ``cloneProps``:
    ``True`` if this should also clone any computed properties as well
    as the skeleton of the given triangulation, or ``False`` if the
    new triangulation should have such properties and skeletal data
    marked as unknown.)doc";

This routine determines if this triangulation is ideal (has a non-
trivial vertex link); however, every vertex link in a 2-manifold
triangulation is either the interval or the circle, and so ideal
triangulations cannot exist. Therefore this routine always returns
``False``.

This no-op routine is provided for consistency with higher dimensional
triangulations, and to assist with writing dimension-agnostic code.

Returns:
    ``False``.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Triangulation_::isMinimal
static const char *isMinimal =
R"doc(Determines whether this is a minimal triangulation of the underlying
2-manifold; that is, it uses the fewest possible triangles.

Testing for minimality is simple in two dimensions (unlike higher
dimensions, where it becomes extremely difficult). With the exception
of the sphere, disc and projective plane (which require a minimum of
2, 1 and 2 triangles respectively), a closed triangulation is minimal
if and only if it has one vertex, and a bounded triangulation is
minimal if and only if it has one vertex per boundary component and no
internal vertices.

The proof is based on a simple Euler characteristic calculation,
whereby the number of triangles ``T`` is ``T = 2I + B - 2C``, where
``I`` and ``B`` are the number of internal and boundary vertices
respectively, and where ``C`` is the Euler characteristic of the
underlying manifold.

Returns:

dimensional faces, components, and boundary components) and all cached
