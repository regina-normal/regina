R"doc(Represents a triangle within a 2-manifold triangulation.

This class is typically referred to by the aliases Simplex<2> or
Triangle<2> (or, for Python users, ``Simplex2`` and ``Triangle2``).

The class template Face<dim, dim> specialises the generic Face class
template in order to work with top-dimensional simplices in a
triangulation. This class Face<2, 2> specialises it further to add
dimension-specific aliases for dimension 2.

See the generic documentation for Face<dim, dim> for an overview of
how the top-dimensional simplex classes work. In Python, you can read
this generic documentation by looking at a higher dimension: try
``help(Simplex5)``.

Triangles do not support value semantics: they cannot be copied,
swapped, or manually constructed. Their location in memory defines
them, and they are often passed and compared by pointer. End users are
never responsible for their memory management; this is all taken care
of by the Triangulation to which they belong.)doc";
