This is a specialisation of the generic Triangulation class template;
see the generic Triangulation documentation for a general overview of
how the triangulation classes work. In Python, you can read this
generic documentation by looking at a higher dimension: try
``help(Triangulation5)``.

This 4-dimensional specialisation offers significant extra
functionality, including many functions specific to 4-manifolds.

A 4-manifold triangulation is built from pentachora: a _pentachoron_
is a 4-dimensional simplex, with five vertices.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.)doc";

If *src* has any locks on top-dimensional simplices and/or their
facets, these locks will also be copied across.

leaves the skeleton uncomputed, you can use the two-argument copy
constructor instead.

If *cloneProps* is ``True``, then this constructor will also clone any

particular, the same numbering and labelling will be used for all
skeletal objects in both triangulations.

If *cloneProps* is ``False``, then these properties and skeletal
objects will be marked as unknown in the new triangulation, and will
be recomputed on demand if/when they are required. Note in particular
that, when the skeleton is recomputed, there is no guarantee that the
numbering and labelling for skeletal objects will be the same as in
the source triangulation.

Regardless of the argument *cloneProps*, if it is known that all
vertex links of *copy* are 3-sphere or 3-balls, this knowledge will be
copied over to the new triangulation.

If *src* has any locks on top-dimensional simplices and/or their

be performed if the check shows it is legal and will not violate any
simplex and/or facet locks (see Simplex<4>::lock() and

If you are trying to reduce the number of vertices without changing
the topology, and if *e* is an edge connecting an internal vertex with
some different vertex, then either collapseEdge() or snapEdge() may be
more appropriate for your situation.

* The advantage of collapseEdge() is that it decreases the number of
  tetrahedra, whereas snapEdge() increases this number (but only by
  four).

* The disadvantages of collapseEdge() are that it cannot always be
  performed, and its validity tests are expensive; snapEdge() on the
  other hand can always be used for edges *e* of the type described
  above.

If this triangulation is currently oriented, then this operation will
preserve the orientation.

Note that after performing this move, all skeletal objects (facets,
components, etc.) will be reconstructed, which means any pointers to
old skeletal objects (such as the argument *e*) can no longer be used.

The eligibility requirements for this move are somewhat involved, and
are discussed in detail in the collapseEdge() source code for those
who are interested.

edge.

This involves replacing the four pentachora joined at that edge with
four new pentachora joined along a new edge *a*. In more detail, the
original configuration of four pentachora should be equivalent to the
join of a double edge and a square with diagonal given by the edge
*e*. The 4-4 move essentially performs a 2-2 move on this square, with
the new diagonal corresponding precisely to the new edge *a*. This
move can be done if:

* the link of edge *e* is a 2-2 move away from being combinatorially
  isomorphic to the boundary of a tetrahedron, and

* the four pentachora joined at *e* are distinct.

If the routine is asked to both check and perform, the move will only
be performed if the check shows it is legal and will not violate any
simplex and/or facet locks (see Simplex<4>::lock() and

can, however, query invariants of the intersection form via routines

which in the simply connected case are enough to determine the
topology of the underlying 4-manifold.

(As an implementation detail, the basis is currently chosen to be the
one produced by constructing a MarkedAbelianGroup using the boundary
maps on the dual faces. This specific choice of basis is subject to
change in future releases of Regina.)

The sign convention for counting intersections is as follows: in a
pentachoron with positive orientation and vertices (0,1,2,3,4), the

normal; note that these normalisation steps could change the topology
of the hypersurface, and in some pathological cases could even reduce
it to the empty hypersurface.

Although normalisation of arbitrary embedded 3-manifolds is messy, for

This move can be done if:

moves, without exceeding a given number of additional pentachora.

Specifically, this routine will iterate through all triangulations
that can be reached from this triangulation via 1-5, 2-4, 3-3 and 4-2
Pachner moves, without ever exceeding *height* additional pentachora
beyond the original number. Note that 5-1 moves are currently not
supported, though this may be added in a future verson of Regina.

For every such triangulation (including this starting triangulation),
this routine will call *action* (which must be a function or some
other callable object).

* *action* must take the following initial argument(s). Either (a) the
  first argument must be a triangulation (the precise type is
  discussed below), representing the triangluation that has been
  found; or else (b) the first two arguments must be of types const
  std::string& followed by a triangulation, representing both the
  triangulation and its isomorphism signature. The second form is
  offered in order to avoid unnecessary recomputation within the
  *action* function; however, note that the signature might not be of
  the IsoSigClassic type (i.e., it might not match the output from the
  default version of isoSig()). If there are any additional arguments
  supplied in the list *args*, then these will be passed as subsequent
  arguments to *action*.

* The triangulation argument will be passed as an rvalue; a typical
  action could (for example) take it by const reference and query it,
  or take it by value and modify it, or take it by rvalue reference
  and move it into more permanent storage.

* *action* must return a boolean. If *action* ever returns ``True``,
  then this indicates that processing should stop immediately (i.e.,
  no more triangulations will be processed).

* *action* may, if it chooses, make changes to this triangulation
  (i.e., the original triangulation upon which retriangulate() was
  called). This will not affect the search: all triangulations that
  this routine visits will be obtained via Pachner moves from the
  original form of this triangulation, before any subsequent changes
  (if any) were made.

* *action* will only be called once for each triangulation (including
  this starting triangulation). In other words, no triangulation will
  be revisited a second time in a single call to retriangulate().

This routine can be very slow and very memory-intensive, since the
number of triangulations it visits may be superexponential in the
number of tetrahedra, and it records every triangulation that it
visits (so as to avoid revisiting the same triangulation again). It is
highly recommended that you begin with *height* = 1, and if necessary
try increasing *height* one at a time until this routine becomes too
expensive to run.

If *height* is negative, then there will be _no_ bound on the number
of additional pentachora. This means that the routine will _never
terminate_, unless *action* returns ``True`` for some triangulation
that is passed to it.

Since Regina 7.0, this routine will not return until the exploration
of triangulations is complete, regardless of whether a progress
tracker was passed. If you need the old behaviour (where passing a
progress tracker caused the enumeration to start in the background),
simply call this routine in a new detached thread.

To assist with performance, this routine can run in parallel
(multithreaded) mode; simply pass the number of parallel threads in
the argument *threads*. Even in multithreaded mode, this routine will
not return until processing has finished (i.e., either *action*
returned ``True``, or the search was exhausted). All calls to *action*
will be protected by a mutex (i.e., different threads will never be
calling *action* at the same time); as a corollary, the action should
avoid expensive operations where possible (otherwise it will become a
serialisation bottleneck in the multithreading).

If this triangulation is not connected, then this routine will do
nothing: it will immediately return ``False``, and if a progress
tracker was passed then it will be immediately marked as finished.

Precondition:
    This triangulation is connected.

Exception ``FailedPrecondition``:
    This triangulation has more than one connected component. If a
    progress tracker was passed, it will be marked as finished before
    the exception is thrown.

Python:
    This function is available in Python, and the *action* argument
    may be a pure Python function. However, its form is more
    restricted: the arguments *tracker* and *args* are removed, so you
    call it as retriangulate(height, threads, action). Moreover,

    Triangulation<4>&&) representing a signature and the
    triangulation, as described in option (b) above.

Parameter ``height``:
    the maximum number of _additional_ pentachora to allow beyond the
    number of pentachora originally present in the triangulation, or a
    negative number if this should not be bounded.

Parameter ``threads``:
    the number of threads to use. If this is 1 or smaller then the
    routine will run single-threaded.

static const char *simplifyExhaustive =
R"doc(Attempts to simplify this triangulation using a slow but exhaustive
search through the Pachner graph. This routine is more powerful but
much slower than intelligentSimplify().

Specifically, this routine will iterate through all triangulations
that can be reached from this triangulation via 1-5, 2-4, 3-3 and 4-2
Pachner moves, without ever exceeding *height* additional pentachora
beyond the original number. Note that 5-1 moves are currently not
supported, though this may be added in a future verson of Regina.

If at any stage it finds a triangulation with _fewer_ pentachora than
the original, then this routine will call intelligentSimplify() to
shrink the triangulation further if possible and will then return
``True``. If it cannot find a triangulation with fewer pentachora then
it will leave this triangulation unchanged and return ``False``.

This routine can be very slow and very memory-intensive: the number of
triangulations it visits may be superexponential in the number of
pentachora, and it records every triangulation that it visits (so as
to avoid revisiting the same triangulation again). It is highly
recommended that you begin with *height* = 1, and if this fails then
try increasing *height* one at a time until either you find a
simplification or the routine becomes too expensive to run.

If *height* is negative, then there will be _no_ bound on the number
of additional pentachora. This means that the routine will not
terminate until a simpler triangulation is found. If no simpler
diagram exists then the only way to terminate this function is to
cancel the operation via a progress tracker (read on for details).

If you want a _fast_ simplification routine, you should call
intelligentSimplify() instead. The benefit of simplifyExhaustive() is
that, for very stubborn triangulations where intelligentSimplify()
finds itself stuck at a local minimum, simplifyExhaustive() is able to
"climb out" of such wells.

Since Regina 7.0, this routine will not return until either the
triangulation is simplified or the exhaustive search is complete,
regardless of whether a progress tracker was passed. If you need the
old behaviour (where passing a progress tracker caused the exhaustive
search to start in the background), simply call this routine in a new
detached thread.

To assist with performance, this routine can run in parallel
(multithreaded) mode; simply pass the number of parallel threads in
the argument *threads*. Even in multithreaded mode, this routine will
not return until processing has finished (i.e., either the
triangulation was simplified or the search was exhausted).

If this routine is unable to simplify the triangulation, then the
triangulation will not be changed.

Precondition:
    This triangulation is connected.

Exception ``FailedPrecondition``:
    This triangulation has more than one connected component. If a
    progress tracker was passed, it will be marked as finished before
    the exception is thrown.

Python:
    The global interpreter lock will be released while this function
    runs, so you can use it with Python-based multithreading.

Parameter ``height``:
    the maximum number of _additional_ pentachora to allow beyond the
    number of pentachora originally present in the triangulation, or a
    negative number if this should not be bounded.

Parameter ``threads``:
    the number of threads to use. If this is 1 or smaller then the
    routine will run single-threaded.

Parameter ``tracker``:
    a progress tracker through which progress will be reported, or
    ``None`` if no progress reporting is required.

Returns:
    ``True`` if and only if the triangulation was successfully
    simplified to fewer pentachora.)doc";

R"doc(Uses all known simplification moves to reduce the triangulation
monotonically to some local minimum number of pentachora.

End users will probably not want to call this routine. You should call
intelligentSimplify() if you want a fast method of simplifying a
triangulation.

The moves used by this routine include collapsing edges, 4-2 moves,
and boundary shelling moves.

Moves that do not reduce the number of pentachora (such as 3-3 moves
or book opening moves) are not used in this routine. Such moves do
however feature in intelligentSimplify().

If this triangulation is currently oriented, then this operation will
preserve the orientation.

.. warning::
    The specific behaviour of this routine will almost certainly
    change between releases. At present, simplification for 4-manifold
    triangulations is extremely weak (as opposed to 3-manifolds, where
    a rich library of simplification techinques is available to call
    upon).

Parameter ``perform``:
    ``True`` if we are to perform the simplifications, or ``False`` if
    we are only to investigate whether simplifications are possible
    (defaults to ``True``).

Returns:
    if *perform* is ``True``, this routine returns ``True`` if and
    only if the triangulation was changed to reduce the number of
    pentachora; if *perform* is ``False``, this routine returns
    ``True`` if and only if it determines that it is capable of

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Triangulation_::snapEdge
static const char *snapEdge =
R"doc(Snaps together the endpoints of an edge connecting an internal vertex
with some different (possibly boundary) vertex, which reduces the
number of vertices in this triangulation by one without changing the
topology.

This operation essentially works by taking a triangle *t* that meets
the given edge *e*, and folding the other two edges of *t* together
about their common vertex. This can be done if and only if *e* is an
edge whose endpoints are distinct and not both boundary (i.e., an edge
of the type described above).

If the routine is asked to both check and perform, the move will only
be performed if the check shows it is legal.

Depending on your situation, collapseEdge() may be a more appropriate
method for reducing the number of vertices without changing the
topology.

* The advantage of collapseEdge() is that it decreases the number of
  tetrahedra, whereas snapEdge() increases this number (but only by
  four).

* The disadvantages of collapseEdge() are that it cannot always be
  performed, and its validity tests are expensive; snapEdge() on the
  other hand can always be used for edges *e* of the type described
  above.

This operation works by prying open a tetrahedron *t* and inserting a
four-pentachoron gadget *g* within the resulting tetrahedral pillow.
In particular, this means that simplex and/or facet locks will never
prevent this operation from taking place: if the tetrahedron *t*
happens to be locked, then this lock will simply move across to one of
the two tetrahedra bounding the gadget *g*.

If this triangulation is currently oriented, then this operation will
preserve the orientation.

Note that after performing this move, all skeletal objects (triangles,
components, etc.) will be reconstructed, which means any pointers to
old skeletal objects (such as the argument *e*) can no longer be used.

Precondition:
    If the move is being performed and no check is being run, it must
    be known in advance that the move is legal.

Precondition:
    The given edge *e* is an edge of this triangulation.

Parameter ``e``:
    the edge whose endpoints are to be snapped together.

Parameter ``check``:
    ``True`` if we are to check whether the move is allowed (defaults
    to ``True``).

Parameter ``perform``:
    ``True`` if we are to perform the move (defaults to ``True``).

Returns:
    If *check* is ``True``, the function returns ``True`` if and only
    if the requested move may be performed without changing the
    topology of the manifold. If *check* is ``False``, the function
    simply returns ``True``.
