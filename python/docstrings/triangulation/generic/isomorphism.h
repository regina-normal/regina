// Docstring regina::python::doc::Isomorphism
constexpr const char *Isomorphism =
R"doc(Represents a combinatorial isomorphism from one *dim*-manifold
triangulation into another.

In essence, a combinatorial isomorphism from triangulation *T* to
triangulation *U* is a one-to-one map from the simplices of *T* to the
simplices of *U* that allows relabelling of both the simplices and
their facets (or equivalently, their vertices), and that preserves
gluings across adjacent simplices.

More precisely: An isomorphism consists of (i) a one-to-one map *f*
from the simplices of *T* to the simplices of *U*, and (ii) for each
simplex *S* of *T*, a permutation *f*_{S} of the facets (0,...,*dim*)
of *S*, for which the following condition holds:

* If facet *k* of simplex *S* and facet *k*' of simplex *S*' are
  identified in *T*, then facet *f*_{S}(*k*) of *f*(S) and facet
  *f*_{S'}(*k*') of *f*(S') are identified in *U*. Moreover, their
  gluing is consistent with the facet/vertex permutations; that is,
  there is a commutative square involving the gluing maps in *T* and
  *U* and the permutations *f*_{S} and *f*_{S'}.

Isomorphisms can be _boundary complete_ or _boundary incomplete_. A
boundary complete isomorphism satisfies the additional condition:

* If facet *x* is a boundary facet of *T* then facet *f*(x) is a
  boundary facet of *U*.

A boundary complete isomorphism thus indicates that a copy of
triangulation *T* is present as an entire component (or components) of
*U*, whereas a boundary incomplete isomorphism represents an embedding
of a copy of triangulation *T* as a subcomplex of some possibly larger
component (or components) of *U*.

Note that for all types of isomorphism, triangulation *U* is allowed
to contain more simplices than triangulation *T*.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.

Python:
    Python does not support templates. Instead this class can be used
    by appending the dimension as a suffix (e.g., Isomorphism2 and
    Isomorphism3 for dimensions 2 and 3).

Template parameter ``dim``:
    the dimension of the triangulations that this isomorphism class
    works with. This must be between 2 and 15 inclusive.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Isomorphism_::__array
constexpr const char *__array =
R"doc(Determines the image of the given source simplex facet under this
isomorphism. This operator returns by value: it cannot be used to
alter the isomorphism.

Parameter ``source``:
    the given source simplex facet; this must be one of the (*dim* +
    1) facets of one of the size() simplices in the source
    triangulation.

Returns:
    the image of the source simplex facet under this isomorphism.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Isomorphism_::__call
constexpr const char *__call =
R"doc(Applies this isomorphism to the given triangulation, and returns the
result as a new triangulation.

An isomorphism represents a combinatorial map from a triangulation *T*
to a triangulation *U*. This routine treats the given triangulation as
the domain *T*, and returns the corresponding range *U*. The given
triangulation *T* is not modified in any way.

In more detail: A new triangulation *U* is returned, so that this
isomorphism represents a one-to-one, onto and boundary complete
isomorphism from *T* to *U*. That is, *T* and *U* will be
combinatorially isomorphic triangulations, and this isomorphism
describes the mapping from the simplices of *T* and their facets to
the simplices of *U* and their facets.

If the given triangulation *T* has any locks on top-dimensional
simplices and/or their facets, then the resulting triangulation *U*
will have matching locks that have been carried through the
isomorphism correctly (i.e., the locks will be copied over to the
appropriate destination simplices and/or facets).

Precondition:
    The simplex images are precisely 0,1,...,size()-1 in some order
    (i.e., this isomorphism does not represent a mapping from a
    smaller triangulation into a larger triangulation).

Exception ``InvalidArgument``:
    The number of top-dimensional simplices in the given triangulation
    is not equal to size() for this isomorphism.

Parameter ``tri``:
    the triangulation to which this isomorphism should be applied.

Returns:
    the new isomorphic triangulation.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Isomorphism_::__call_2
constexpr const char *__call_2 =
R"doc(Returns the image of the given facet-of-simplex under this
isomorphism.

Specifically:

* If ``f.simp`` is in the range 0,1,...,size()-1 inclusive (i.e., *f*
  denotes a facet of an actual top-dimensional simplex), then this
  routine will return an object denoting facet ``facetPerm(f.facet)``
  of simplex ``simpImage(f.simp)``.

* If ``f.simp`` is negative (i.e., *f* takes a before-the-start
  value), or if ``f.simp`` is at least size() (i.e., *f* takes a
  boundary or past-the-end value), then this routine will return *f*
  unchanged (but see the precondition below).

Precondition:
    If this isomorphism maps a smaller triangulation into a larger
    triangulation (in particular, if the simplex images under this
    isomorphism are not just some reordering of 0,1,...,size()-1),
    then *f* must not denote a boundary or past-the-end value. This is
    because a boundary or past-the-end value is encoded by using a
    past-the-end value of ``FacetSpec::simp``. If this isomorphism
    maps into a larger triangulation then this past-the-end simplex
    number would need to change, but the isomorphism does not actually
    know what the new value of ``FacetSpec::simp`` should be.

Parameter ``f``:
    the facet-of-simplex which should be transformed by this
    isomorphism.

Returns:
    the image of *f* under this isomorphism.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Isomorphism_::__call_3
constexpr const char *__call_3 =
R"doc(Applies this isomorphism to the given facet pairing, and returns the
result as a new facet pairing.

Although the Isomorphism class was designed to represent mappings
between isomorphic triangulations, it can just as well describe
mappings between isomorphic facet pairings. In particular, if *iso*
represents this isomorphism and if *p* were the facet pairing of some
triangulation *tri*, then ``iso(p)`` would be the facet pairing for
the triangulation ``iso(tri)``. Of course, this routine works directly
with the facet pairing, and does not actually construct any
triangulations at all.

This routine behaves correctly even if some facets of *p* are
unmatched (i.e., if *p* models a triangulation with boundary facets).

Precondition:
    The simplex images are precisely 0,1,...,size()-1 in some order
    (i.e., this isomorphism does not represent a mapping from a
    smaller triangulation into a larger triangulation).

Exception ``InvalidArgument``:
    The number of top-dimensional simplices described by the given
    facet pairing is not equal to size() for this isomorphism.

Parameter ``p``:
    the facet pairing to which this isomorphism should be applied.

Returns:
    the new isomorphic facet pairing.)doc";

Parameter ``src``:
    the isomorphism to copy.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Isomorphism_::__eq
constexpr const char *__eq =
R"doc(Determines whether this and the given isomorphism are identical.

Two isomorphisms are considered _identical_ if they act on the same
number of top-dimensional simplices, and all destination simplex
numbers and facet permutations are the same for both isomorphisms.

In particular it is only the simplex, facet and vertex _labels_ that
matter: an isomorphism does not refer to a specific triangulation, and
there is no sense in which the two isomorphisms need to act on the
same triangulations and/or point to the same destination Simplex
objects.

It is safe to compare isomorphisms of different sizes (in which case
this routine will return ``False``).

Parameter ``other``:
    the isomorphism to compare with this.

Returns:
    ``True`` if and only if this and the given isomorphism are
    identical.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Isomorphism_::__inc
constexpr const char *__inc =
R"doc(A preincrement operator that changes this to be the next isomorphism
in an iteration through all possible isomorphisms of this size.

The order of iteration is lexicographical, by the sequence of simplex
images and then by the sequence of facet permutations. Facet
permutations, in turn, are ordered by their indices in the array
Perm<dim>::Sn.

In particular, the identity isomorphism is the first in such an
iteration. If this isomorphism is the _last_ in such an iteration,
then this operator will "wrap around" and set this to the identity.

Precondition:
    The class Perm<dim+1> supports the preincrement operator;
    currently this means that *dim* must be at most 6.

Python:
    This routine is named inc() since Python does not support the
    increment operator. Unlike other Regina classes, here inc() wraps
    the preincrement operator (not the postincrement operator), since
    the postincrement operator is significantly more expensive. To
    avoid confusion, the python inc() function returns ``None`` (not
    this isomorphism).

Returns:
    a reference to this isomorphism after the increment.)doc";

Python:

    must be set using setSimpImage() and setFacetPerm() instead.

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Isomorphism_::__mul
constexpr const char *__mul =
R"doc(Returns the composition of this isomorphism with the given

This follows the same order convention as Regina's permutation
classes: the composition ``a * b`` first applies the right-hand
isomorphism *b*, and then the left-hand isomorphism *a*.

Precondition:
    The source triangulation for this isomorphism (the left-hand side)
    is at least as large as the destination triangulation for *rhs*
    (the right-hand side). In other words, the maximum value of
    ``rhs.simpImage(i)`` over all *i* must be less than
