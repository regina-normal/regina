// Docstring regina::python::doc::Triangulation
constexpr const char *Triangulation =
R"doc(A *dim*-dimensional triangulation, built by gluing together
*dim*-dimensional simplices along their (*dim*-1)-dimensional facets.
Typically (but not necessarily) such triangulations are used to
represent *dim*-manifolds.

Structure of triangulations
===========================

Triangulations in Regina are not the same as pure simplicial
complexes, for two reasons:

* The only identifications that the user can explicitly specify are
  gluings between *dim*-dimensional simplices along their
  (*dim*-1)-dimensional facets. All other identifications between
  *k*-faces (for any *k*) are simply consequences of these
  (*dim*-1)-dimensional gluings. In contrast, a simplicial complex
  allows explicit gluings between faces of any dimension.

* There is no requirement for a *k*-face to have (*k*+1) distinct
  vertices (so, for example, edges may be loops). Many distinct
  *k*-faces of a top-dimensional simplex may be identified together as
  a consequence of the (*dim*-1)-dimensional gluings, and indeed we
  are even allowed to glue together two distinct facets of the same
  *dim*-simplex. In contrast, a simplicial complex does not allow any
  of these situations.

Amongst other things, this definition is general enough to capture any
reasonable definition of a *dim*-manifold triangulation. However,
there is no requirement that a triangulation must actually represent a
manifold (and indeed, testing this condition is undecidable for
sufficiently large *dim*).

You can construct a triangulation from scratch using routines such as
newSimplex() and Simplex<dim>::join(). There are also routines for
exporting and importing triangulations in bulk, such as isoSig() and
fromIsoSig() (which use _isomorphism signatures_), or
dumpConstruction() and fromGluings() (which use C++ code).

Skeleta and components
======================

In additional to top-dimensional simplices, this class also tracks:

* connected components of the triangulation, as represented by the
  class Component<dim>;

* boundary components of the triangulation, as represented by the
  class BoundaryComponent<dim>;

* lower-dimensional faces of the triangulation, as represented by the
  classes Face<dim, subdim> for *subdim* = 0,...,(*dim*-1).

Such objects are temporary: whenever the triangulation changes, they
will be deleted and rebuilt, and any pointers to them will become
invalid. Likewise, if the triangulation is deleted then all component
objects will be deleted alongside it.

The packet tree
===============

Since Regina 7.0, this is no longer a "packet type" that can be
inserted directly into the packet tree. Instead a Triangulation is now
a standalone mathematatical object, which makes it slimmer and faster
for ad-hoc use. The consequences of this are:

* If you create your own Triangulation, it will not have any of the
  usual packet infrastructure. You cannot add it into the packet tree,
  and it will not support a label, tags, child/parent packets, and/or
  event listeners.

* To include a Triangulation in the packet tree, you must create a new
  PacketOf<Triangulation>. This _is_ a packet type, and supports
  labels, tags, child/parent packets, and event listeners. It derives
  from Triangulation, and so inherits the full Triangulation
  interface.

* If you are adding new functions to this class that edit the internal
  data structures of the triangulation, you must still remember to
  create a ChangeEventSpan (or a ChangeAndClearSpan). This will ensure
  that, if the triangulation is being managed by a
  PacketOf<Triangulation>, then the appropriate packet change events
  will be fired. All other events (aside from packetToBeChanged() and
  packetWasChanged() are managed directly by the
  PacketOf<Triangulation> wrapper class.

C++ housekeeping
================

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.

For Regina's standard dimensions, this template is specialised and
offers _much_ more functionality. In order to use these specialised
classes, you will need to include the corresponding headers (e.g.,
triangulation/dim2.h for *dim* = 2, or triangulation/dim3.h for *dim*
= 3).

Python:
    Python does not support templates. Instead this class can be used
    by appending the dimension as a suffix (e.g., Triangulation2 and
    Triangulation3 for dimensions 2 and 3).

Template parameter ``dim``:
    the dimension of the underlying triangulation. This must be
    between 2 and 15 inclusive.)doc";

constexpr const char *__copy =

This will also clone any computed properties (such as homology,
fundamental group, and so on), as well as the skeleton (vertices,
edges, components, etc.). In particular, the same numbering and
labelling will be used for all skeletal objects.

If *src* has any locks on top-dimensional simplices and/or their
facets, these locks will also be copied across.

If you want a "clean" copy that resets all properties to unknown and
leaves the skeleton uncomputed, you can use the two-argument copy
constructor instead.

R"doc(Creates a new copy of the given triangulation, with the option of
whether or not to clone its computed properties also.

If *cloneProps* is ``True``, then this constructor will also clone any
computed properties (such as homology, fundamental group, and so on),
as well as the skeleton (vertices, edges, components, etc.). In
particular, the same numbering and labelling will be used for all
skeletal objects in both triangulations.

If *cloneProps* is ``False``, then these properties and skeletal
objects will be marked as unknown in the new triangulation, and will
be recomputed on demand if/when they are required. Note in particular
that, when the skeleton is recomputed, there is no guarantee that the
numbering and labelling for skeletal objects will be the same as in
the source triangulation.

If *src* has any locks on top-dimensional simplices and/or their
facets, these locks will be copied across _only_ if *cloneProps* is
``True``. If *cloneProps* is ``False`` then the new triangulation will
have no locks at all.

Parameter ``src``:
    the triangulation to copy.

Parameter ``cloneProps``:
    ``True`` if this should also clone any computed properties as well
    as the skeleton of the given triangulation, or ``False`` if the
    new triangulation should have such properties and skeletal data
    marked as unknown.)doc";

be moved to *other*, and all top-dimensional simplices that belong to

objects (such as lower-dimensional faces, components, and boundary
components) and all cached properties will be swapped.

In particular, any pointers or references to Simplex<dim> and/or
Face<dim, subdim> objects will remain valid.

This routine will behave correctly if *other* is in fact this
triangulation.

    This swap function is _not_ marked ``noexcept``, since it fires
    change events on both triangulations which may in turn call
    arbitrary code via any registered packet listeners.
