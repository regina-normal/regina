matched simplex facets that cross the two sides of the resulting
partition). If there are still multiple solutions, then the cut that
is returned will have the two pieces with sizes that are as close as
possible to equal. If there are _still_ multiple solutions, then the
choice will be arbitrary.

Note that it is possible that no solution exists (e.g. this could
happen if the matching is a star graph and *minSide* is greater than
1).

.. warning::
    Currently the implementation of this routine is exhaustive, and so
    the running time is exponential in the size of this facet pairing.

Parameter ``minSide``:
    the minimum number of simplices in each of the two connected

// Docstring regina::python::doc::detail::FacetPairingBase_::dot
constexpr const char *dot =
R"doc(Returns a Graphviz DOT representation of the graph that describes this
facet pairing.

Every vertex of this graph represents a simplex, and every edge
represents a pair of simplex facets that are joined together. Note
that for a closed triangulation this graph will be entirely (*dim* +
1)-valent; for triangulations with boundary facets, some graph
vertices will have degree *dim* or less.

The graph can either be written as a complete DOT graph, or as a
clustered subgraph within some larger DOT graph (according to whether
the argument *subgraph* is passed as ``False`` or ``True``).

If a complete DOT graph is being written, the output may be used as a
standalone DOT file ready for use with Graphviz.

If a subgraph is being written, the output will contain a single
``subgraph`` section that should be inserted into some larger DOT
file. Note that the output generated by dotHeader() or
writeDotHeader(), followed by one or more subgraphs and then a closing
curly brace will suffice. The subgraph name will begin with the string
``pairing_``.

The argument *prefix* will be prepended to the name of each graph
vertex, and will also be used in the name of the graph or subgraph.
Using unique prefixes becomes important if you are calling dot() or
writeDot() several times to generate several subgraphs for use in a
single DOT file. If the *prefix* argument is null or empty then a
default prefix will be used.

Note that this routine generates undirected graphs, not directed
graphs. The final DOT file should be used with either the *neato* or
*fdp* programs shipped with Graphviz.

If you are simply writing this string to an output stream then you
should call writeDot() instead, which is more efficient.

Parameter ``prefix``:
    a string to prepend to the name of each graph vertex, and to
    include in the graph or subgraph name; see above for details.

Parameter ``subgraph``:
    ``False`` if a complete standalone DOT graph should be output, or
    ``True`` if a clustered subgraph should be output for use in some
    larger DOT file.

Parameter ``labels``:
    indicates whether graph vertices will be labelled with the
    corresponding simplex numbers.

Returns:
    the output of writeDot(), as outlined above.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::detail::FacetPairingBase_::dotHeader
constexpr const char *dotHeader =
R"doc(Returns header information for a Graphviz DOT file that will describe
the graphs for one or more facet pairings. See the dot() documentation
for further information on such graphs.

The output will be in the Graphviz DOT language, and will include
appropriate display settings for graphs, edges and nodes. The opening
brace for a ``graph`` section of the DOT file is included.

This routine may be used with dot() or writeDot() to generate a single
DOT file containing the graphs for several different facet pairings. A
complete DOT file can be produced by calling this routine, then
calling dot() or writeDot() in subgraph mode for each facet pairing,
then outputting a final closing curly brace.

Note that if you require a DOT file containing the graph for only a
single facet pairing, this routine is unnecessary; you may simply call
dot() or writeDot() in full graph mode instead.

This routine is suitable for generating undirected graphs, not
directed graphs. The final DOT file should be used with either the
*neato* or *fdp* programs shipped with Graphviz.

If you are simply writing this string to an output stream then you
should call writeDotHeader() instead, which is more efficient.

Parameter ``graphName``:
    the name of the graph to write in the DOT header. If this is null
    or empty then a default graph name will be used.

Returns:
    the DOT header information, as outlined above.

// Docstring regina::python::doc::detail::FacetPairingBase_::findAllPairings
constexpr const char *findAllPairings =
R"doc(Generates all possible facet pairings satisfying the given
constraints. Only connected facet pairings (pairings in which each
simplex can be reached from each other via a series of individual
matched facets) will be produced.

Each facet pairing will be produced precisely once up to isomorphism.
Facet pairings are considered isomorphic if they are related by a
relabelling of the simplices and/or a renumbering of the (*dim* + 1)
facets of each simplex. Each facet pairing that is generated will be a
lexicographically minimal representative of its isomorphism class,
i.e., will be in canonical form as described by isCanonical().

For each facet pairing that is generated, this routine will call
*action* (which must be a function or some other callable object).

* The first argument to *action* must be a const reference to a
  FacetPairing<dim>. This will be the facet pairing that was found. If
  *action* wishes to keep the facet pairing, it should take a deep
  copy (not a reference), since the facet pairing may be changed and
  reused after *action* returns.

* If *action* takes a FacetPairing<dim>::IsoList as its second
  argument (which may be as a reference, and may have const/volatile
  qualifiers), then this will be the list of all automorphisms of the
  facet pairing that was found. This list will be passed by value
  using move semantics. If *action* does not take a second argument,
  or if the second argument is of a different type, then the list of
  automorphisms will not be passed.

* If there are any additional arguments supplied in the list *args*,
  then these will be passed as subsequent arguments to *action*.

* *action* must return ``void``.

Because this class cannot represent an empty facet pairing, if the
argument *nSimplices* is zero then no facet pairings will be generated
at all.

.. warning::
    If you are allowing a large number of boundary facets, then the
    automorphisms groups could be enormous. In this case it is highly
    recommended that your action does _not_ take the list of all
    automorphisms as its second argument, since this will avoid the
    enormous memory cost of storing and passing such a list.

Python:
    This function is available, and *action* may be a pure Python
    function. However, its form is more restricted: *action* must take
    both a facet pairing and its automorphisms (i.e., the
    automorphisms argument is not optional); moreover, it cannot take
    any additional arguments beyond these. As a consequence, the
    additional *args* list is omitted also.

Parameter ``nSimplices``:
    the number of simplices whose facets should be (potentially)
    matched.

Parameter ``boundary``:
    determines whether any facets may be left unmatched. This set
    should contain ``True`` if pairings with at least one unmatched
    facet are to be generated, and should contain ``False`` if
    pairings with no unmatched facets are to be generated.

Parameter ``nBdryFacets``:
    specifies the precise number of facets that should be left
    unmatched. If this parameter is negative, it is ignored and no
    additional restriction is imposed. If parameter *boundary* does
    not contain ``True``, this parameter is likewise ignored. If
    parameter *boundary* does contain true and this parameter is non-
    negative, only pairings with precisely this many unmatched facets
    will be generated. In particular, if this parameter is positive
    then pairings with no unmatched facets will not be produced
    irrespective of whether ``False`` is contained in parameter
    *boundary*. Note that, in order to produce any pairings at all,
    this parameter must be of the same parity as ``nSimplices *
    (dim+1)``, and can be at most ``(dim-1) * nSimplices + 2``.

Parameter ``action``:
    a function (or other callable object) to call for each facet
    pairing that is found.

Parameter ``args``:
    any additional arguments that should be passed to *action*,
    following the initial facet pairing argument and the optional
    automorphism argument.)doc";
