R"doc(Helper class that provides core functionality for a boundary component
of a *dim*-dimensional triangulation.

Each boundary component is represented by the class
BoundaryComponent<dim>, which uses this as a base class. End users
should not need to refer to BoundaryComponentBase directly.

See the BoundaryComponent class notes for further information.

Neither this class nor the "end user" class BoundaryComponent<dim>
support value semantics: they cannot be copied, swapped, or manually
constructed. Their memory is managed by the Triangulation class, and
their locations in memory define them. See BoundaryComponent<dim> for
further details.

Python:
    This base class is not present, but the "end user" class
    BoundaryComponent<dim> is.

Template parameter ``dim``:
    the dimension of the underlying triangulation. This must be
    between 2 and 15 inclusive.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::detail::BoundaryComponentBase_::build
constexpr const char *build =
R"doc(Returns the full (*dim*-1)-dimensional triangulation of this boundary
component. Note that this triangulation is read-only (though of course
you can clone it and then operate upon the clone).

If this is a real boundary component (i.e., it is built from one or
more (*dim*-1)-faces), then the triangulation of this boundary
component is as follows:

* Let *i* lie between 0 and size()-1 inclusive. Then simplex *i* of
  the returned (*dim*-1)-dimensional triangulation is a copy of
  ``facet(i)`` of this boundary component, and its vertices
  0,...,*dim*-1 are numbered in the same way. To relate these
  (*dim*-1)-face vertex numbers to the vertex numbers of top-
  dimensional simplices in the overall *dim*-dimensional
  triangulation, see Simplex<dim>::faceMapping<dim-1>().

* If this boundary component stores lower-dimensional faces (i.e., if
  the class constant *allFaces* is ``True``), then a similar
  correspondence holds for these lower-dimensional faces also: for
  each *i*, *k*-face *i* of the returned triangulation is a copy of
  ``face<k>(i)`` of this boundary component, and its vertices are
  numbered in the same way. As an exception, this correspondence will
  not hold for dimensions *k* where there exist _pinched_ *k*-faces on
  the boundary (i.e., faces where different sections of the boundary
  are pinched together, meaning that these faces must be duplicated
  when the boundary is triangulated).

If this boundary component consists only of a single vertex (i.e.,
this is an ideal or invalid vertex boundary component), then this
routine returns the triangulation of the corresponding vertex link.
See Vertex::buildLink() for details.

This routine is fast, since it caches the boundary triangulation.
Moreover, it is guaranteed that the full skeleton of this
(*dim*-1)-dimensional triangulation will have been generated already.

R"doc(Returns the Euler characteristic of this boundary component. If the

it is an ideal vertex), then the Euler characteristic of the vertex
link will be returned.

This function is, in all "normal" cases, equivalent to triangulating
the boundary component via build() and then calling
Triangulation<dim-1>::eulerCharTri() on the result.

The exception comes from triangulations with "pinched" faces whose
links have multiple boundary components (e.g., a vertex whose link is
a multiply-punctured sphere, marking a point where different parts of
the boundary are "pinched together"). If there are such faces, then
this routine will return a well-defined but topologically meaningless
result. Essentially, this routine only counts such faces once, even
though they "should" be counted multiple times on the boundary since
they can be "seen" from distinct sections of the (*dim*-1)-dimensional
boundary. Of course such a triangulation cannot represent a
*dim*-manifold anyway, and so if you do have pinched faces then you
almost certainly have bigger problems to deal with.

Precondition:
    *dim* is one of Regina's standard dimensions.

.. warning::
    If this boundary component itself forms an ideal
    (*dim*-1)-dimensional triangulation, then again this result is
    well-defined but topologically meaningless (since it is equivalent
    to calling eulerCharTri() and not eulerCharManifold() on the
    triangulated boundary). However, again such boundary components
    cannot appear in a *dim*-manifold, and so if you have such
    boundary components then you almost certainly have bigger problems
    than this.

Note that the index of a face in the boundary component need not be
the index of the same face in the overall triangulation. However, if
this is a real boundary component (i.e., it is built from one or more
(*dim*-1)-faces), then the index of each *subdim*-face in this
boundary component will match the index of the corresponding

build().

The returned object is guaranteed to be an instance of ListView, which

The object that is returned will remain valid only for as long as this
boundary component object exists. In particular, the object will
become invalid any time that the triangulation changes (since all

their place). Therefore it is best to treat this object as temporary
