The object that is returned is lightweight, and can be happily copied
by value. The C++ type of the object is subject to change, so C++
users should use ``auto`` (just like this declaration does).

The returned object is guaranteed to be an instance of ListView, which
means it offers basic container-like functions and supports range-
based ``for`` loops. The elements of the list will be read-only
objects of type FaceEmbedding<dim, subdim>. For example, your code
might look like:

Let *F* denote this *subdim*-face of the triangulation, and let *L*
denote the *lowerdim*-face of the triangulation that corresponds to
the given subface of *F*. Then the permutation returned by this
routine maps the vertex numbers (0, ..., *lowerdim*) of *L* to the
corresponding vertex numbers of *F*. This is with respect to the
inherent labellings (0, ..., *lowerdim*) and (0, ..., *subdim*) of the
vertices of *L* and *F* respectively.

In particular, if this routine returns the permutation *p*, then the
images *p*[0,...,*lowerdim*] will be some permutation of the vertices
Face<subdim, lowerdim>::ordering(face)[0,...,*lowerdim*].

This routine differs from Simplex<dim>::faceMapping<lowerdim>() in how
it handles the images of (*lowerdim*+1, ..., *dim*):

* This routine will map (*lowerdim*+1, ..., *subdim*) to the remaining
  vertices of this face in an arbitrary order, and will map
  (*subdim*+1, ..., *dim*) to (*subdim*+1, ..., *dim*) again in an

A face whose link is not appropriate will always be marked as invalid.

Precondition:
    The dimension *dim* is one of Regina's standard dimensions. Any
    attempt to use this routine in higher dimensions *dim* will result

This routine is only available for faces of codimension 1; that is,

When the skeletal structure of a triangulation is first computed, a
maximal forest in the dual 1-skeleton of the triangulation is also
constructed. Each dual edge in this maximal forest represents a
(*dim*-1)-face of the (primal) triangulation.

This maximal forest will remain fixed until the triangulation changes,
at which point it will be recomputed (as will all other skeletal
objects, such as connected components and so on). There is no
guarantee that, when it is recomputed, the maximal forest will use the
same dual edges as before.

This routine identifies whether this (*dim*-1)-face belongs to the
dual forest. In this sense it performs a similar role to
Simplex::facetInMaximalForest(), but this routine is typically easier
to use.

If the skeleton has already been computed, then this routine is very
fast (since it just returns a precomputed answer).

constexpr const char *isLocked =

Essentially, locking a face of dimension (*dim*-1) means that the face

locks work and what their implications are.

This is equivalent to calling Simplex<dim>::isFacetLocked() from one
of the simplices on either side of this (*dim*-1)-face.

See Triangulation<dim>::hasLocks() for a convenient way to test
whether any top-dimensional simplex and/or (*dim*-1)-face is locked

There are several conditions that might make a *subdim*-face of a
*dim*-dimensional triangulation invalid:

1. if the face is identified with itself under a non-identity
   permutation (e.g., an edge is identified with itself in reverse, or
   a triangle is identified with itself under a rotation);

2. if the face does not have an appropriate link. Here the meaning of
   "appropriate" depends upon the type of face:

   * for a face that belongs to some boundary facet(s) of the
     triangulation, its link must be a topological ball;

   * for a vertex that does not belong to any boundary facets, its
     link must be a closed (*dim* - 1)-manifold;

   * for a (*subdim* ≥ 1)-face that does not belong to any boundary
     facets, its link must be a topological sphere.

Condition (1) is tested for all dimensions *subdim* and *dim*.
Condition (2) is more difficult, since it relies on undecidable
problems. As a result, (2) is _only_ tested when *dim* is one of
Regina's standard dimensions.

If this face is invalid, then it is possible to find out why. In non-
standard dimensions, this must mean that the face fails condition (1)
above. In standard dimensions, you can call the functions
hasBadIdentification() and/or hasBadLink() to determine whether the
failure is due to conditions (1) or (2) respectively.

Returns:
    for standard dimensions *dim*, returns ``True`` if and only if
    this face is valid according to both conditions (1) and (2) above;
