constexpr const char *boundaryMap =

the triangulation, where the face dimension does not need to be known
until runtime.

For C++ programmers who know *subdim* at compile time, you are better
off using the template function boundaryMap<subdim>() instead, which
is slightly faster.

This is the boundary map that you would use if you were building the
homology groups manually from a chain complex.

Unlike homology(), this code does _not_ use the dual skeleton: instead
it uses the primal (i.e., ordinary) skeleton.

* The main advantage of this is that you can easily match rows and
  columns of the returned matrix to faces of this triangulation.

* The main disadvantage is that ideal vertices are _not_ treated as
  though they were truncated; instead they are just treated as 0-faces
  that appear as part of the chain complex.

The matrix that is returned should be thought of as acting on column
vectors. Specifically, the *c*th column of the matrix corresponds to
the *c*th *subdim*-face of this triangulation, and the *r*th row
corresponds to the *r*th (*subdim*-1)-face of this triangulation.

For the boundary map, we fix orientations as follows. In simplicial
homology, for any *k*, the orientation of a *k*-simplex is determined
by assigning labels 0,...,*k* to its vertices. For this routine, since
every *k*-face *f* is already a *k*-simplex, these labels will just be
the inherent vertex labels 0,...,*k* of the corresponding Face<k>
object. If you need to convert these labels into vertex numbers of a
top-dimensional simplex containing *f*, you can use either
Simplex<dim>::faceMapping<k>(), or the equivalent routine
FaceEmbedding<k>::vertices().

If you wish to convert these boundary maps to homology groups
yourself, either the AbelianGroup class (if you do not need to track
which face is which) or the MarkedAbelianGroup class (if you do need
to track individual faces) can help you do this.

Note that, unlike many of the templated face-related routines, this
routine explicitly supports the case *subdim* = *dim*.

This routine takes linear time in the dimension *dim*. For C++

Specifically, this counts the number of *subdim*-faces for which
isBoundary() returns ``True``. This may lead to some unexpected
results in non-standard scenarios; for example:

* In non-standard dimensions, ideal vertices are not recognised and so
  will not be counted as boundary;

* In an invalid triangulation, the number of boundary faces reported
  here may be smaller than the number of faces obtained when you
  triangulate the boundary using BoundaryComponent::build(). This is

some graph vertices will have degree *dim* or less.

The output from this routine can be used as a standalone DOT file,
ready for use with Graphviz. This DOT file will describe an
_undirected_ graph, and should be used with either the *neato* or
*fdp* programs shipped with Graphviz.

The functions Triangulation<dim>::dot() and FacetPairing<dim>::dot()

* Triangulation<dim>::dot() does not support _subgraph_ output (where
  you construct a large DOT file containing the dual graphs of many

* Triangulation<dim>::dot() makes more use of colour, in particular to

    the output of writeDot(), as outlined above.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::detail::TriangulationBase_::dualBoundaryMap
constexpr const char *dualBoundaryMap =
R"doc(Returns the boundary map from dual *subdim*-faces to dual
(*subdim*-1)-faces of the triangulation, where the face dimension does
not need to be known until runtime.

For C++ programmers who know *subdim* at compile time, you are better
off using the template function dualBoundaryMap<subdim>() instead,
which is slightly faster.

This function is analogous to boundaryMap(), but is designed to work
with dual faces instead of ordinary (primal) faces. In particular,
this is used in the implementation of homology(), which works with the
dual skeleton in order to effectively truncate ideal vertices.

The matrix that is returned should be thought of as acting on column
vectors. Specifically, the *c*th column of the matrix corresponds to
the *c*th dual *subdim*-face of this triangulation, and the *r*th row
corresponds to the *r*th dual (*subdim*-1)-face of this triangulation.
Here we index dual faces in the same order as the (primal) faces of
the triangulation that they are dual to, except that we omit primal
_boundary_ faces (i.e., primal faces for which Face::isBoundary()
returns ``True``). Therefore, for triangulations with boundary, the
dual face indices and the corresponding primal face indices might not
be equal.

For this dual boundary map, for positive dual face dimensions *k*, we
fix the orientations of the dual *k*-faces as follows:

* In simplicial homology, the orientation of a *k*-simplex is
  determined by assigning labels 0,...,*k* to its vertices.

* Consider a dual *k*-face *d*, and let this be dual to the primal
  (*dim*-*k*)-face *f*. In general, *d* will _not_ be a simplex. Let
  *B* denote the barycentre of *f* (which also appears as the "centre"
  point of *d*).

* Let *emb* be an arbitrary FaceEmbedding<dim-k> for *f* (i.e., chosen
  from ``f.embeddings()``), and let *s* be the corresponding top-
  dimensional simplex containing *f* (i.e., ``emb.simplex()``). For
  the special case of dual edges (*k* = 1), this choice matters; here
  we choose *emb* to be the first embedding (that is, ``f.front()``).
  For larger *k* this choice does not matter; see below for the
  reasons why.

* Now consider how *d* intersects the top-dimensional simplex *s*.
  This intersection is a *k*-polytope with *B* as one of its vertices.
  We can extend this polytope away from *B*, pushing it all the way
  through the simplex *s*, until it becomes a *k*-simplex *g* whose
  vertices are *B* along with the *k* "unused" vertices of *s* that do
  _not_ appear in *f*.

* We can now define the orientation of the dual *k*-face *d* to be the
  orientation of this *k*-simplex *g* that contains it. All that
  remains now is to orient *g* by choosing a labelling 0,...,*k* for
  its vertices.

* To orient *g*, we assign the label 0 to *B*, and we assign the
  labels 1,...,*k* to the "unused" vertices
  ``v[dim-k+1]``,...,``v[dim]`` of *s* respectively, where *v* is the
  permutation ``emb.vertices()``.

* Finally, we note that for *k* > 1, the orientation for *d* does not
  depend on the particular choice of *s* and *emb:* by the
  preconditions and the fact that this routine only considers duals of
  non-boundary faces, the link of *f* must be a sphere, and therefore
  the images of those "other" vertices are fixed in a way that
  preserves orientation as you walk around the link. See the
  documentation for Simplex<dim>::faceMapping() for details.

* For the special case of dual edges (*k* = 1), the conditions above
  can be described more simply: the two endpoints of the dual edge *d*
  correspond to the two top-dimensional simplices on either side of
  the (*dim*-1)-face *f*, and we orient *d* by labelling these
  endpoints (0, 1) in the order (``f.back()``, ``f.front()``).

If you wish to convert these boundary maps to homology groups
yourself, either the AbelianGroup class (if you do not need to track
which dual face is which) or the MarkedAbelianGroup class (if you do
need to track individual dual faces) can help you do this.

Precondition:
    This triangulation is valid and non-empty.

Exception ``InvalidArgument``:

// Docstring regina::python::doc::detail::TriangulationBase_::dualToPrimal

For C++ programmers who know *subdim* at compile time, you are better
off using the template function dualToPrimal<subdim>() instead, which
is slightly faster.

The matrix that is returned should be thought of as acting on column
vectors. Specifically, the *c*th column of the matrix corresponds to
the *c*th dual *subdim*-face of this triangulation, and the *r*th row
corresponds to the *r*th primal *subdim*-face of this triangulation.

We index and orient these dual and primal faces in the same manner as
dualBoundaryMap() and boundaryMap() respectively. In particular, dual
faces are indexed in the same order as the primal
(*dim*-*subdim*)-faces of the triangulation that they are dual to,
except that we omit primal boundary faces. See dualBoundaryMap() and
boundaryMap() for further details.

The key feature of this map is that, if a column vector *v* represents
a cycle *c* in the dual chain complex (i.e., it is a chain with zero
boundary), and if this map is represented by the matrix *M*, then the
vector ``M×v`` represents a cycle in the primal chain complex that
belongs to the same *subdim*th homology class as *c*.

Regarding implementation: the map is constructed by (i) subdividing
each dual face into smaller *subdim*-simplices whose vertices are
barycentres of primal faces of different dimensions, (ii) moving each
barycentre to vertex 0 of the corresponding face, and then (iii)
discarding any resulting simplices with repeated vertices (which
become "flattened" to a dimension less than *subdim*).

One side-effect of this operation is that all spherical boundary

This operation is performed by attaching a new *dim*-simplex to each

in a way that mirrors the adjacencies of the underlying boundary
facets. Each boundary component will thereby be pushed up through the
new simplices and converted into a cusp formed using vertices of these

In Regina's standard dimensions, where triangulations also support an

operation.

In dimension 2, every boundary component is spherical and so this

This routine is an analogue to the variant of fromGluings() that takes
a C++ initialiser list; however, here the input data may be
constructed at runtime (which makes it accessible to Python, amongst
other things).

The iterator range (*beginGluings*, *endGluings*) should encode the
list of gluings for the triangulation. Each iterator in this range
must dereference to a tuple of the form (*simp*, *facet*, *adj*,
*gluing*); here *simp*, *facet* and *adj* are all integers, and
*gluing* is of type Perm<dim+1>. Each such tuple indicates that facet
*facet* of top-dimensional simplex number *simp* should be glued to
top-dimensional simplex number *adj* using the permutation *gluing*.
In other words, such a tuple encodes the same information as calling
``simplex(simp).join(facet, simplex(adj), gluing)`` upon the
triangulation being constructed.

Every gluing should be encoded from _one direction only_. This means,
for example, that to build a closed 3-manifold triangulation with *n*
tetrahedra, you would pass a list of 2*n* such tuples. If you attempt
to make the same gluing twice (e.g., once from each direction), then
this routine will throw an exception.

Any facet of a simplex that does not feature in the given list of
gluings (either as a source or a destination) will be left as a
boundary facet.

Note that, as usual, the top-dimensional simplices are numbered
0,...,(*size*-1), and the facets of each simplex are numbered
0,...,*dim*.

As an example, Python users can construct the figure eight knot
complement as follows:

```
tri = Triangulation3.fromGluings(2, [
    ( 0, 0, 1, Perm4(1,3,0,2) ), ( 0, 1, 1, Perm4(2,0,3,1) ),

.. note::
    The assumption is that the iterators dereference to a
    std::tuple<size_t, int, size_t, Perm<dim+1>>. However, this is not
    strictly necessary - the dereferenced type may be any type that
    supports std::get (and for which std::get<0..3>() yields suitable

The fundamental group is computed in the dual 2-skeleton. This means:

* Likewise, if the triangulation contains any invalid faces of
  dimension 0,1,...,(*dim*-3), these will effectively be truncated
  also.

* In contrast, if the triangulation contains any invalid
  (*dim*-2)-faces (i.e., codimension-2-faces that are identified with
  themselves under a non-trivial map), the fundamental group will be
  computed _without_ truncating the centroid of the face. For
  instance, if a 3-manifold triangulation has an edge identified with
  itself in reverse, then the fundamental group will be computed
  without truncating the resulting projective plane cusp. This means
  that, if a barycentric subdivision is performed on a such a

A problem with computing homology is that, if *dim* is not one of
Regina's standard dimensions, then Regina cannot actually _detect_
ideal vertices (since in general this requires solving undecidable
problems). Currently we resolve this by insisting that, in higher
dimensions, the homology dimension *k* is at most (*dim*-2); the
underlying algorithm will then effectively truncate _all_ vertices
(since truncating "ordinary" vertices whose links are spheres or balls
does not affect the *k*th homology in such cases).

In general, this routine insists on working with a valid triangulation
(see isValid() for what this means). However, for historical reasons,
if you are computing first homology (*k* = 1) then your triangulation
is allowed to be invalid, though the results might or might not be
useful to you. The homology will be computed using the dual skeleton:
what this means is that any invalid faces of dimension
0,1,...,(*dim*-3) will be treated as though their centroids had been

An _isomorphism signature_ is a compact representation of a
triangulation that uniquely determines the triangulation up to
combinatorial isomorphism. That is, for any fixed signature type *T*,
two triangulations of dimension *dim* are combinatorially isomorphic
if and only if their isomorphism signatures of type *T* are the same.

The length of an isomorphism signature is proportional to ``n log n``,
where *n* is the number of top-dimenisonal simplices. The time
required to construct it is worst-case ``O((dim!) n² log² n)``. Whilst
this is fine for large triangulations, it becomes very slow for large
_dimensions_; the main reason for introducing different signature
types is that some alternative types can be much faster to compute in
practice.

Whilst the format of an isomorphism signature bears some similarity to
dehydration strings for 3-manifolds, they are more general:
isomorphism signatures can be used with any triangulations, including
closed, bounded and/or disconnected triangulations, as well as
triangulations with many simplices. Note also that 3-manifold
dehydration strings are not unique up to isomorphism (they depend on
the particular labelling of tetrahedra).

The routine fromIsoSig() can be used to recover a triangulation from
an isomorphism signature (only if the default encoding has been used,
but it does not matter which signature type was used). The
triangulation recovered might not be identical to the original, but it
_will_ be combinatorially isomorphic. If you need the precise
relabelling, you can call isoSigDetail() instead.

Regina supports several different variants of isomorphism signatures,
which are tailored to different computational needs; these are
currently determined by the template parameters *Type* and *Encoding:*

* The *Type* parameter identifies which signature type is to be
  constructed. Essentially, different signature types use different
  rules to determine which labelling of a triangulation is
  "canonical". The default type IsoSigClassic is slow (it never does
  better than the worst-case time described above); its main advantage
  is that it is consistent with the original implementation of
  isomorphism signatures in Regina 4.90.

* The *Encoding* parameter controls how Regina encodes a canonical
  labelling into a final signature. The default encoding
  IsoSigPrintable returns a std::string consisting entirely of
  printable characters in the 7-bit ASCII range. Importantly, this
  default encoding is currently the only encoding from which Regina
  can _reconstruct_ a triangulation from its isomorphism signature.

You may instead pass your own type and/or encoding parameters as
template arguments. Currently this facility is for internal use only,
and the requirements for type and encoding parameters may change in
future versions of Regina. At present:

* The *Type* parameter should be a class that is constructible from a
  componenent reference, and that offers the member functions
  simplex(), perm() and next(); see the implementation of
  IsoSigClassic for details.

* The *Encoding* parameter should be a class that offers a *Signature*
  type alias, and static functions emptySig() and encode(). See the
  implementation of IsoSigPrintable for details.

For a full and precise description of the classic isomorphism
signature format for 3-manifold triangulations, see _Simplification
paths in the Pachner graphs of closed orientable 3-manifold
triangulations_, Burton, 2011, ``arXiv:1110.6080``. The format for
other dimensions is essentially the same, but with minor dimension-
specific adjustments.

Python:
    Although this is a templated function, all of the variants
    supplied with Regina are available to Python users. For the
    default type and encoding, you can simply call isoSig(). For other
    signature types, you should call the function as isoSig_*Type*,
    where the suffix *Type* is an abbreviated version of the *Type*
    template parameter; one such example is ``isoSig_EdgeDegrees``
    (for the case where *Type* is the class IsoSigEdgeDegrees).
    Currently Regina only offers one encoding (the default), and so
    there are no suffixes for encodings.

R"doc(Deduces the number of top-dimensional simplices in a connected
triangulation from its isomorphism signature.

See isoSig() for more information on isomorphism signatures. It will
be assumed that the signature describes a triangulation of dimension
*dim*.

Currently this routine only supports isomorphism signatures that were
created with the default encoding (i.e., there was no *Encoding*
template parameter passed to isoSig()).

If the signature describes a connected triangulation, this routine
will simply return the size of that triangulation (e.g., the number of
tetrahedra in the case *dim* = 3). You can also pass an isomorphism
signature that describes a disconnected triangulation; however, this
routine will only return the number of top-dimensional simplices in
the first connected component. If you need the total size of a
disconnected triangulation, you will need to reconstruct the full
triangulation by calling fromIsoSig() instead.

This routine is very fast, since it only examines the first few
characters of the isomorphism signature (in which the size of the
first component is encoded). However, a side-effect of this is that it
is possible to pass an _invalid_ isomorphism signature and still
receive a positive result. If you need to test whether a signature is
valid or not, you must call fromIsoSig() instead, which will examine
the entire signature in full.

Essentially, an isomorphism signature is a compact representation of a
triangulation that uniquely determines the triangulation up to
combinatorial isomorphism. See isoSig() for much more detail on
isomorphism signatures as well as the support for different signature
types and encodings.

As described in the isoSig() notes, you can call fromIsoSig() to
recover a triangulation from an isomorphism signature (assuming the
default encoding was used). Whilst the triangulation that is recovered
will be combinatorially isomorphic to the original, it might not be
identical. This routine returns not only the isomorphism signature,
but also an isomorphism that describes the precise relationship
between this triangulation and the reconstruction from fromIsoSig().

Specifically, if this routine returns the pair (*sig*, *relabelling*),
this means that the triangulation reconstructed from
``fromIsoSig(sig)`` will be identical to ``relabelling(this)``.

Python:
    Although this is a templated function, all of the variants
    supplied with Regina are available to Python users. For the
    default type and encoding, you can simply call isoSigDetail(). For
    other signature types, you should call the function as

    ``isoSigDetail_EdgeDegrees`` (for the case where *Type* is the
    class IsoSigEdgeDegrees). Currently Regina only offers one
    encoding (the default), and so there are no suffixes for

For C++ programmers who know *k* at compile time, you are better off
using the template function markedHomology<k>() instead, which is
slightly faster.

This is a specialised homology routine; you should only use it if you
need to understand how individual *k*-faces (or chains of *k*-faces)
appear within the homology group.

* The major disadvantage of this routine is that it does not truncate
  ideal vertices. Instead it computes the homology of the union of all
  top-dimensional simplices, working directly with the boundary maps
  between (*k*+1)-faces, *k*-faces and (*k*-1)-faces of the
  triangulation. If your triangulation is ideal, then this routine
  will almost certainly _not_ give the correct homology group for the
  underlying manifold. If, however, all of your vertex links are
  spheres or balls (i.e., the triangulation is closed or all of its
  boundary components are built from unglued (*dim*-1)-faces), then
  the homology of the manifold will be computed correctly.

* The major advantage is that, instead of returning a simpler
  AbelianGroup, this routine returns a MarkedAbelianGroup. This allows
  you to track chains of individual *k*-faces of the triangulation as
  they appear within the homology group. Specifically, the chain
  complex cordinates with this MarkedAbelianGroup represent precisely
  the *k*-faces of the triangulation in the same order as they appear

means it offers basic container-like functions and supports range-
based ``for`` loops. Note that the elements of the list will be
pointers, so your code might look like:

```
for (Simplex<dim>* s : tri.simplices()) { ... }
```

The object that is returned will remain up-to-date and valid for as
long as the triangulation exists: even as simplices are added and/or
removed, it will always reflect the simplices that are currently in
the triangulation. Nevertheless, it is recommended to treat this
object as temporary only, and to call simplices() again each time you
need it.

    access to the list of all top-dimensional simplices.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::detail::TriangulationBase_::subdivide
constexpr const char *subdivide =
R"doc(Does a barycentric subdivision of the triangulation. This is done in-
place, i.e., the triangulation will be modified directly.

Each top-dimensional simplex *s* is divided into (*dim* + 1) factorial
sub-simplices by placing an extra vertex at the centroid of every face
of every dimension. Each of these sub-simplices *t* is described by a
permutation *p* of (0, ..., *dim*). The vertices of such a sub-simplex
*t* are:

* vertex *p*[0] of *s*;

* the centre of edge (*p*[0], *p*[1]) of *s*;

* the centroid of triangle (*p*[0], *p*[1], *p*[2]) of *s*;

* ...

* the centroid of face (*p*[0], *p*[1], *p*[2], *p*[*dim*]) of *s*,
  which is the entire simplex *s* itself.

The sub-simplices have their vertices numbered in a way that mirrors
the original simplex *s:*

* vertex *p*[0] of *s* will be labelled *p*[0] in *t*;

* the centre of edge (*p*[0], *p*[1]) of *s* will be labelled *p*[1]
  in *t*;

* the centroid of triangle (*p*[0], *p*[1], *p*[2]) of *s* will be
  labelled *p*[2] in *t*;

* ...

* the centroid of *s* itself will be labelled *p*[*dim*] in *t*.

In particular, if this triangulation is currently oriented, then this
barycentric subdivision will preserve the orientation.

If simplex *s* has index *i* in the original triangulation, then its
sub-simplex corresponding to permutation *p* will have index ``((dim +
1)! * i + p.orderedSnIndex())`` in the resulting triangulation. In
other words: sub-simplices are ordered first according to the original
simplex that contains them, and then according to the lexicographical
ordering of the corresponding permutations *p*.

Precondition:
    *dim* is one of Regina's standard dimensions. This precondition is
    a safety net, since in higher dimensions the triangulation would
    explode too quickly in size (and for the highest dimensions,
    possibly beyond the limits of ``size_t``).

.. warning::
    In dimensions 3 and 4, both the labelling and ordering of sub-
    simplices in the subdivided triangulation has changed as of Regina
    5.1. (Earlier versions of Regina made no guarantee about the
    labelling and ordering; these guarantees are also new to Regina
    5.1).

Exception ``LockViolation``:
    This triangulation contains at least one locked top-dimensional
    simplex and/or facet. This exception will be thrown before any
    changes are made. See Simplex<dim>::lock() and
    Simplex<dim>::lockFacet() for further details on how such locks
    work and what their implications are.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::detail::TriangulationBase_::translate

face of this triangulation, using simplex numbers for the translation.

Typically this routine would be used when the given face comes from a
triangulation that is combinatorially identical to this, and you wish
to obtain the corresponding face of this triangulation.

Specifically: if *other* refers to face *i* of top-dimensional simplex
number *k* of some other triangulation, then this routine will return
face *i* of top-dimensional simplex number *k* of this triangulation.
Note that this routine does _not_ use the face indices within each
triangulation (which is outside the user's control), but rather the
simplex numbering (which the user has full control over).

This routine behaves correctly even if *other* is a null pointer.

Precondition:
    This triangulation contains at least as many top-dimensional
    simplices as the triangulation containing *other* (though, as
    noted above, in typical scenarios both triangulations would
    actually be combinatorially identical).

Template parameter ``subdim``:
    the face dimension; this must be between 0 and *dim*-1 inclusive.

Parameter ``other``:
    the face to translate.
