// Docstring regina::python::doc::SurfaceFilter
static const char *SurfaceFilter =
R"doc(A packet that accepts or rejects normal surfaces. Different subclasses
of SurfaceFilter represent different filtering methods.

When deriving classes from SurfaceFilter:

* Add a new filter constant to the SurfaceFilterType enum;

* Create a new subclass *C* of SurfaceFilter, which begins with the
  REGINA_SURFACE_FILTER macro;

* Perform all tasks required for this new innate packet type *C*, as
  outlined in the Packet class documentation;

* Override the virtual function writeTextShort(), as well as all pure
  virtual functions from both the Packet and SurfaceFilter base
  classes (except for those already provided by REGINA_PACKET and
  REGINA_SURFACE_FILTER).

Like all packet types, Regina's filter types do not support C++ move
semantics, since this would interfere with the structure of the packet
tree. They do support copy construction, copy assignment and swaps,
but only in the derived filter classes (e.g., you cannot assign from
the polymorphic base class SurfaceFilter). Moreover, these operations
only copy/swap the filter content, not the packet infrastructure
(e.g., they do not touch packet labels, or the packet tree, or event
listeners).)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::SurfaceFilterCombination
static const char *SurfaceFilterCombination =
R"doc(A normal surface filter that simply combines other filters. This
filter will combine, using boolean *and* or *or*, all of the filters
that are immediate children of this packet. This packet may have
children that are not normal surface filters; such children will
simply be ignored.

If there are no immediate child filters, a normal surface will be
accepted if this is an *and* filter and rejected if this is an *or*
filter.

Like all packet types, this class does not support C++ move semantics
since this would interfere with the structure of the packet tree. It
does support copy construction, copy assignment and swaps; however,
these operations only copy/swap the mathematical content, not the
packet infrastructure (e.g., they do not touch packet labels, or the
packet tree, or event listeners).)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::SurfaceFilterProperties
static const char *SurfaceFilterProperties =
R"doc(A normal surface filter that filters by basic properties of the normal
surface.

If a property of the surface (such as Euler characteristic or
orientability) cannot be determined, the surface will pass any test
based on that particular property. For instance, say a surface is
required to be both orientable and compact, and say that orientability
cannot be determined. Then the surface will be accepted solely on the
basis of whether or not it is compact.

Like all packet types, this class does not support C++ move semantics
since this would interfere with the structure of the packet tree. It
does support copy construction, copy assignment and swaps; however,
these operations only copy/swap the mathematical content, not the
