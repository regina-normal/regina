R"doc(Stores a piece of data alongside every normal disc within a particular
normal surface.

End users should not refer to this class directly; instead use one of
the type aliases DiscSetSurfaceData<T> or DiscSetSurface.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.

Template parameter ``TetData``:
    This must be either (1) DiscSetTet, in which case there will be no
    additional data stored for each normal disc; or (2) a class of the
    form DiscSetTetData<T>, in which case there will be data of type
    *T* stored alongside each normal disc.

.. warning::
    This class converts the number of normal discs of a given type
    from LargeInteger to ``unsigned long``. See the precondition
    below.

Precondition:
    The number of normal discs of a particular type in a particular
    tetrahedron can be represented by a long integer.

Precondition:
    This class should only be used with *embedded* normal surfaces.

Python:
    The only instance of this class that is available through python
    is DiscSetSurface (i.e., the "vanilla" case where *TetData* is the
    type DiscSetTet).)doc";

There are 10 disc types. Types 0-3 represent triangles 0-3, types 4-6
represent quads 0-2 and types 7-9 represent octagons 0-2.

Discs of a specific type are assigned numbers from 0 upwards.
Triangular discs are numbered outwards from the vertex they surround.
Quad discs and octagonal discs are numbered outwards away from vertex
0 of the tetrahedron.

Note that, unlike DiscType in which the meaning of DiscType::type is
flexible, the meaning of DiscSpec::type is fixed as described above.

This class is designed to work alongside
DiscSetSurfaceDataImpl<TetData>. Typically you would not need to
specify the template argument *TetData*; for copy initialisation you
can use the ``auto`` type, and when constructing from a
DiscSetSurfaceData<T> the template argument can be automatically
deduced.

Python:
    The only instance of this class that is available through python
    is the iterator for DiscSetSurface (i.e., the "vanilla" case where
    *TetData* is the type DiscSetTet). Moreover, instead of the C++
    interface described here, in Python DiscSetSurface and this class
    together implement the Python iterable/iterator interface. The
    DiscSetSurface class implements ``__iter__()``, which returns a
    DiscSpecIterator; then DiscSpecIterator implements ``next()``,
    which either returns the next normal disc in the set or else
    throws a ``StopException`` if there are no more discs to return.)doc";
