R"doc(Implements a modified Contejean-Devie algorithm for enumerating
Hilbert bases. This is based on the stack-based algorithm described in
"An efficient incremental algorithm for solving systems of linear
Diophantine equations", Inform. and Comput. 113 (1994), 143-172, and
has been modified to allow for additional constraints (such as the
quadrilateral constraints from normal surface theory).

All routines of interest within this class are static; no object of
this class should ever be created.

.. warning::
    For normal surface theory, the Contejean-Devie algorithm is
    extremely slow, even when modified to incorporate admissibility
    constraints. Consider using the much faster HilbertPrimal or
    HilbertDual instead.)doc";

namespace HilbertCD_ {

// Docstring regina::python::doc::HilbertCD_::enumerate
static const char *enumerate =
R"doc(Determines the Hilbert basis that generates all integer points in the
intersection of the *n*-dimensional non-negative orthant with some
linear subspace. The resulting basis elements will be of the class
*RayClass*, and will be passed into the given action function one at a
time.

The non-negative orthant is an *n*-dimensional cone with its vertex at
the origin. The extremal rays of this cone are the *n* non-negative
coordinate axes. This cone also has *n* facets, where the *i*th facet
is the non-negative orthant of the plane perpendicular to the *i*th
coordinate axis.

This routine takes a linear subspace, defined by the intersection of a
set of hyperplanes through the origin (this subspace is described as a
matrix, with each row giving the equation for one hyperplane).

The purpose of this routine is to compute the Hilbert basis of the set
of all integer points in the intersection of the original cone with
this linear subspace. The resulting list of basis vectors will contain
no duplicates or redundancies.

The parameter *constraints* may contain a set of validity constraints,
in which case this routine will only return _valid_ basis elements.
Each validity constraint is of the form "at most one of these
coordinates may be non-zero"; see the ValidityConstraints class for
details. These contraints have the important property that, although
validity is not preserved under addition, _invalidity_ is.

For each of the resulting basis elements, this routine will call
*action* (which must be a function or some other callable object).
This action should return ``void``, and must take exactly one
argument, which will be the basis element stored using *RayClass*. The
argument will be passed as an rvalue; a typical *action* would take it
as an rvalue reference (RayClass&&) and move its contents into some
other more permanent storage.

Precondition:
    The template argument RayClass is derived from (or equal to)
    Vector<T>, where *T* is one of Regina's arbitrary-precision
    integer classes (Integer or LargeInteger).

.. warning::
    For normal surface theory, the Contejean-Devie algorithm is
    extremely slow, even when modified to incorporate admissibility
    constraints. Consider using the much faster HilbertPrimal or
    HilbertDual instead.

Python:
    There are two versions of this function available in Python. The
    first version is the same as the C++ function; here you must pass
    *action*, which may be a pure Python function. The second form
    does not have an *action* argument; instead you call
    ``enumerate(subspace, constraints)``, and it returns a Python list
    containing all Hilbert basis elements. In both versions, the
    argument *RayClass* is fixed as VectorInt.

Parameter ``action``:
    a function (or other callable object) that will be called for each
    basis element. This function must take a single argument, which
    will be passed as an rvalue of type RayClass.

Parameter ``subspace``:
    a matrix defining the linear subspace to intersect with the given
    cone. Each row of this matrix is the equation for one of the
    hyperplanes whose intersection forms this linear subspace. The
    number of columns in this matrix must be the dimension of the
    overall space in which we are working.

Parameter ``constraints``:
    a set of validity constraints as described above, or
    ValidityConstraints::none if none should be imposed.)doc";
