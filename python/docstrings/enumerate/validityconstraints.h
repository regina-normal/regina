// Docstring regina::python::doc::ValidityConstraints
static const char *ValidityConstraints =
R"doc(Represents a set of combinatorial validity constraints for use with
polytope vertex enumeration.

Vertex enumeration routines such as DoubleDescription::enumerate()
take a cone (specifically the non-negative orthant), form the
intersection of that cone with a given linear subspace, and return the
extremal rays of the new cone that results.

In some cases we are only interested in _valid_ rays of the new cone.
The ValidityConstraints class stores a number of "validity
constraints"; a ray is then "valid" if it satisfies all of these
constraints.

Each individual constraint encodes a subset *S* of coordinate
positions, and requires that a ray can only be non-zero on at most
_one_ of those coordinate positions. Equivalently, if we were to
assume that the linear subspace is in general position with respect to
the coordinate axes (which it is often not), then the *i*th facet of
the cone would come from the hyperplane perpendicular to *i*th
coordinate; such a constraint would then require that a ray can only
lie outside at most one of the facets corresponding to the coordinate
positions in *S*.

This class is tailored specifically to constraints that come from
normal surfaces and angle structures:

* We assume that the coordinate positions are grouped into consecutive
  _blocks_, each of the same size. For instance, in standard
  coordinates for normal surfaces, there is one block per tetrahedron,
  each of size seven (since each tetrahedron provides four triangle
  coordinates and three quadrilateral coordinates).

* It is okay if there are additional coordinates that appear beyond
  these blocks (e.g., the final scaling coordinate in angle structure
  coordinates). However, these additional coordinates cannot be used
  in any validity constraints.

It is assumed that all constraints are either _local_ or _global:_

* A _local_ constraint involves coordinates within a single block
  only. It is assumed that, if local constraints are used, then
  _every_ block will use analogous local constraints (where
  "analagous" means they use the same coordinate positions relative to
  the start of each block). An example of a local constraint is the
  quadrilateral constraints from normal surface theory, which require
  that each tetrahedron has at most one non-zero quadrilateral
  coordinate.

* A _global_ constraint involves coordinates in every block; moreover,
  each block must constraint the same coordinates relative to the
  start of the block. An example of a global constraint is with almost
  normal surfaces, where we require that the entire surface has at
  most one non-zero octagonal coordinate.

You can add a full set of local constraints (one for each block) using
a single call to addLocal(), and you can add a single global
constraint by calling addGlobal().

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.)doc";

Parameter ``blockSize``:

A call to addGlobal() will add a single global constraint, using
coordinates from every block. Within each block, the coordinates that
are constrained will be those listed in the given iterator range,
where these coordinate positions are given relative to the start of
each block.

As an example, for almost normal surfaces in standard coordinates, you
can encode the constraint that there is at most one octagon in the
entire surface by passing an iterator range that encodes the three
integers 7, 8, 9.

Precondition:
    The iterator type *iterator*, when dereferenced, can be assigned
    to a native C++ ``int``.

Python:
    Instead of the iterators *begin* and *end*, this routine takes a
    python list of integers.

Parameter ``begin``:
    the beginning of the list of coordinates to constraint within each
    block, relative to the start of the block, as outlined above.

A single call to addLocal() will effectively add one local constraint

surfaces in standard coordinates, you can pass an iterator range that

every block. Each global constraint that was added using addGlobal()
will produce just one bitmask.

The bits corresponding to coordinate positions that are constrained

Calling ``bitmasks()`` is equivalent to calling ``bitmasks(len)``,
where *len* is the block size multiplied by the number of blocks.

As an example, this is appropriate for normal surface coordinate
systems, where the normal coordinates incorporate precisely one block
for each tetrahedron and nothing more. However, it is not appropriate
for angle structure coordinates, where there is an additional "scaling
coordinate" that appears after all the blocks.

Each local constraint "pattern" that was added using addLocal() will

every block. Each global constraint that was added using addGlobal()
