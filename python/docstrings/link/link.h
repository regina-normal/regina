// Docstring regina::python::doc::Crossing
static const char *Crossing =
R"doc(Represents a single crossing in a link diagram. The two strands of the
link that run over and under the crossing respectively can be accessed
through routines such as over(), under(), upper(), lower(), and
strand().

Each crossing has a sign, which is either positive (denoted by +1) or
negative (denoted by -1):

* In a positive crossing, the upper strand passes over the lower
  strand from left to right:

```
  -----\ /----->
        \
  -----/ \----->
```

* In a negative crossing, the upper strand passes over the lower
  strand from right to left:

```
  -----\ /----->
        /
  -----/ \----->
```

If a link has *n* crossings, then these are numbered 0,...,*n*-1. The
number assigned to this crossing can be accessed by calling index().
Note that crossings in a link may be reindexed when other crossings
are added or removed - if you wish to track a particular crossing
through such operations then you should use a pointer to the relevant
Crossing object instead.

Crossings do not support value semantics: they cannot be copied,
swapped, or manually constructed. Their location in memory defines
them, and they are often passed and compared by pointer. End users are
never responsible for their memory management; this is all taken care
of by the Link to which they belong.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Framing
static const char *Framing =
R"doc(Indicates one of the standard framings of a knot or link. Here a
_framing_ refers to a choice of normal vector field along the knot or
link. Equivalently, a framing refers to a choice of longitude on the
torus bounding each component of the link.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Link
static const char *Link =
R"doc(Represents a directed knot or link in the 3-sphere.

This class supports links with any number of components (including
zero), and it also supports components with no crossings (which form
additional unknot components of the overall link).

Since Regina 7.0, this is no longer a "packet type" that can be
inserted directly into the packet tree. Instead a Link is now a
standalone mathematatical object, which makes it slimmer and faster
for ad-hoc use. The consequences of this are:

* If you create your own Link, it will not have any of the usual
  packet infrastructure. You cannot add it into the packet tree, and
  it will not support a label, tags, child/parent packets, and/or
  event listeners.

* To include a Link in the packet tree, you must create a new
  PacketOf<Link>. This _is_ a packet type, and supports labels, tags,
  child/parent packets, and event listeners. It derives from Link, and
  so inherits the full Link interface.

* If you are adding new functions to this class that edit the internal
  data structures of the link, you must still remember to create a
  ChangeEventSpan (or a ChangeAndClearSpan). This will ensure that, if
  the link is being managed by a PacketOf<Link>, then the appropriate
  packet change events will be fired. All other events (aside from
  packetToBeChanged() and packetWasChanged() are managed directly by
  the PacketOf<Link> wrapper class.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::StrandRef
static const char *StrandRef =
R"doc(A reference to one of the two strands of a link that pass each other
at a crossing.

This class is a simple wrapper that stores (i) a pointer to the
relevant crossing; and (ii) an integer to denote whether this refers
to the upper strand (which passes over the crossing) or the lower
strand (which passes under the crossing).

A "null reference" is one whose crossing is the null pointer.

This class can also be used to refer to an _arc_ of a link; that is, a
section of the link that runs from one crossing to the next. When used
in this way:

* The arc referred to is the arc beginning at the given strand of the
  given crossing, and moving forwards along the orientation of the
  link to the next crossing.

* A null reference is used to refer to an entire zero-crossing unknot
  component (as opposed to a typical arc which has well-defined start
  and end points). Of course the link in question may not have such a
  component, or may have many such components; the behaviour of the
  code in such circumstances is documented in the individual routines
  that take arc references as arguments.

* The increment and decrement operators, as well as next() and prev(),
  behave as expected: they follow the link forward and backward
  respectively along its orientation.

These objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with
std::swap(), with no need for any specialised move operations or swap
functions.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Link_::bracket
static const char *bracket =
R"doc(Returns the Kauffman bracket polynomial of this link diagram.

Note that the bracket polynomial is not an invariant - it is preserved
under Reidemeister moves II and III, but not I.

If this is the empty link, then this routine will return the zero
polynomial.

Bear in mind that each time the link changes, all of its polynomials
will be deleted. Thus the reference that is returned from this routine
should not be kept for later use. Instead, bracket() should be called
again; this will be instantaneous if the bracket polynomial has
already been calculated.

If this polynomial has already been computed, then the result will be
cached and so this routine will be very fast (since it just returns
the previously computed result). Otherwise the computation could be
quite slow, particularly for larger numbers of crossings.

Since Regina 7.0, this routine will not return until the polynomial
computation is complete, regardless of whether a progress tracker was
passed. If you need the old behaviour (where passing a progress
tracker caused the computation to start in the background), simply
call this routine in a new detached thread.

.. warning::
    The naive algorithm can only handle a limited number of crossings
    (currently at most 63). If you pass ALG_NAIVE and you have too
    many crossings (which is not advised, since the naive algorithm
    requires 2^*n* time), then this routine will ignore your choice of
    algorithm and use the treewidth-based algorithm regardless.

Exception ``NotImplemented``:
    This link is *so* large that the maximum possible strand ID cannot
    fit into an ``int``. (On a typical machine where ``int`` is
    32-bit, this would require over a _billion_ crossings). Note that,
    if you have such a link, then this function (which is exponential
    time) would be intractably slow anyway.

Python:
    The global interpreter lock will be released while this function
    runs, so you can use it with Python-based multithreading.

Parameter ``alg``:
    the algorithm with which to compute the polynomial. If you are not
    sure, the default (ALG_DEFAULT) is a safe choice. If you wish to
    specify a particular algorithm, there are currently two choices:
    ALG_NAIVE is a slow algorithm that computes the Kauffman bracket
    by resolving all crossings in all possible ways, and ALG_TREEWIDTH
    uses a fixed-parameter tractable treewidth-based algorithm.

Parameter ``tracker``:
    a progress tracker through which progress will be reported, or
    ``None`` if no progress reporting is required.

Returns:
    the bracket polynomial, or the zero polynomial if the calculation
    was cancelled via the given progress tracker.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Link_::brief
static const char *brief =
R"doc(Outputs this link in Regina's own brief write-only format. This format
is concise, but contains enough information to manually reconstruct
the complete link diagram.

This format cannot (yet) be used to read links back into Regina, and
so it is not good for external storage, or for passing links between
different programs (or even different instances of Regina). It was
originally designed for use with the test suite, where it was used to
ensure that links with being created and/or manipulated correctly.

The output will contain the following elements, separated by single
spaces:

* a sequence of signs (``+`` or ``-``), concatenated together, giving
  the signs of the crossings in order from crossing 0 to crossing
  size()-1;

* a description of each component of the link, in order from component
  0 to component countComponents()-1. Each component will be written
  in the form ``( a b c ... )``, indicating the crossings that are
  encountered as we follow the component in the forward direction from
  its starting strand. Each element *a*, *b*, *c* and so on will be
  written in the format used by the StrandRef class: either ``^n``
  when passing over crossing *n*, or ``_n`` when passing under
  crossing *n*.

For example, the Whitehead link as returned by ExampleLink.whitehead()
will give the following brief output:

```
--++- ( ^0 _1 ^4 _3 ^2 _4 ) ( _0 ^1 _2 ^3 )
```

As a special case, if the link contains no crossings, then the output
will not begin with a space; instead it will simply be a sequence of
the form ``( ) ( ) ... ( )``.

The string will not end in a newline.

There is also a variant of brief() that writes directly to an output
stream.

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Link_::complement
static const char *complement =
R"doc(Returns an ideal triangulation of the complement of this link in the
3-sphere.

The triangulation will have one ideal vertex for each link component.
Assuming you pass *simplify* as ``True`` (the default), there will
typically be no internal vertices; however, this is not guaranteed.

Initially, each tetrahedron will be oriented according to a right-hand
rule: the thumb of the right hand points from vertices 0 to 1, and the
fingers curl around to point from vertices 2 to 3. If you pass
*simplify* as ``True``, then Regina will attempt to simplify the
triangulation to as few tetrahedra as possible: this may relabel the
tetrahedra, though their orientations will be preserved.

This is the same triangulation that would be produced by passing this
link to the Triangulation<3> constructor.

Parameter ``simplify``:
    ``True`` if and only if the triangulation of the complement should
    be simplified to use as few tetrahedra as possible.

static const char *component =
R"doc(Returns a strand in the given component of this link.

For each component of the link, this routine returns a "starting
strand". You can traverse the entire component by beginning at this
starting strand and repeatedly incrementing it through a routine such
as StrandRef::operator++ or StrandRef::next().

If a component has no crossings (which means it must be a separate
unknot component), then this routine will return a null reference
(i.e., StrandRef::crossing() will return ``None``).

Parameter ``index``:
    the index of the requested component. This must be between 0 and
    countComponents()-1 inclusive.

Returns:
    a "starting strand" for traversing the component at the given

The returned object is guaranteed to be an instance of ListView, which
means it offers basic container-like functions and supports range-

strand for some components; more precisely, iterating through this
list is equivalent to calling ``component(0)``, ``component(1)``, ...,
``component(countComponents()-1)`` in turn. As an example, your code
might look like:

```
for (const StrandRef& c : link.components()) { ... }

modification.

This routine may be expanded in future versions of Regina to allow
more flexibility (in particular, to allow you to choose which
components of the two links to graft together, and/or at which strands
to graft them).

If either link is empty (i.e., contains no components at all), then
the result will simply be a clone of the other link (with no
composition operation performed).

  different components of the link;

* if two crossings are not connected then the underlying link must be
  splittable (though this need not happen in the other direction: one
  can have a diagram of a splittable link in which all crossings are
  connected with each other).

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Link_::dt
static const char *dt =
R"doc(Exports this knot in either numerical or alphabetical Dowker-
Thistlethwaite notation, returning a string.

Like classical Gauss codes, Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation essentially
describes the 4-valent graph of a knot but not the particular
embedding in the plane. It comes with two major restrictions:

* In general, it does not carry enough information to uniquely
  reconstruct a knot. For instance, both a knot and its reflection can
  be described by the same Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation; moreover,
  for composite knots, the same notation can describe inequivalent
  knots (even when allowing for reflections).

* Parsing Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation is complex, since it requires
  an embedding to be deduced using some variant of a planarity testing
  algorithm.

If you need a code that specifies the knot uniquely and/or that is
fast to parse, consider using the _oriented_ Gauss code instead, which
resolves both of these issues.

For an *n*-crossing knot, Regina supports two variants of Dowker-
Thistlethwaite notation:

* a _numerical_ variant (the default), which is a sequence of *n* even
  signed integers as described (amongst other places) in Section 2.2
  of C. C. Adams, "The knot book", W. H. Freeman & Co., 1994;

* an _alphabetical_ variant, which transforms the numerical notation
  into a sequence of letters by replacing positive integers
  (2,4,6,...) with lower-case letters (``a``,``b``,``c``,...), and
  replacing negative integers (-2,-4,-6,...) with upper-case letters
  (``A``,``B``,``C``,...). This alphabetical variant can only be used
  for knots with 26 crossings or fewer; for larger knots this routine
  will throw an exception if the alphabetical variant is requested.

As an example, you can describe the trefoil using numerical Dowker-
Thistlethwaite notation as:

```
4 6 2
```

In alphabetical Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation, this becomes:

```
bca
```

Currently Regina only supports Dowker-Thistlethwaite codes for knots,
not empty or multiple component links. If this link does not have
precisely one component, then this routine will throw an exception. It
is possible that in future versions of Regina, Dowker-Thistlethwaite
codes will be expanded to cover all possible link diagrams (hence the
choice of NotImplemented as the exception type).

For numerical Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation, this routine will format
the list of integers as a string. The integers will be separated by
single spaces, and there will be no newlines. For alphabetical Dowker-
Thistlethwaite notation, the string that is returned will not contain
any whitespace at all.

For the numerical variant, the routine dtData() returns this same data
in machine-readable format (as a C++ vector), instead of the human-
readable format used here (a string). There is also another variant of
dt() that can write either the numerical or the alphabetical variant
directly to an output stream.

Exception ``NotImplemented``:
    Either this link is empty or has multiple components, or *alpha*
    is true and it has more than 26 crossings.

Parameter ``alpha``:
    ``True`` to use alphabetical notation, or ``False`` (the default)

variants of Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation, this dtData() routine

R"doc(Creates a new knot from either alphabetical or numerical Dowker-
Thistlethwaite notation, presented as a string.

Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation essentially describes the 4-valent
graph of a knot but not the particular embedding in the plane. As a
result, there can be topological ambiguities when a knot is
reconstructed from Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation; these are described
in the warnings below.

Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation comes in two forms: numerical and
alphabetical. For an *n*-crossing knot, the numerical form is a
sequence of *n* even signed integers, and the alphabetical form is a
sequence of *n* case-sensitive letters. As an example, you can
construct the trefoil using either of the following strings:

```
4 6 2
bca
```

See dt(bool) for a full description of Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation
as it is used in Regina, as well as its limitations.

There are two variants of this routine. This variant takes a single
string, which is either (i) the alphabetical notation, in which any
whitespace within the string will be ignored; or (ii) the numerical
notation, in which the integers are combined together and separated by
whitespace. The other variant of this routine is only for numerical
Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation, and it takes a sequence of integers
defined by a pair of iterators.

In this variant (the string variant), the string may contain
additional leading or trailing whitespace; moreover, for numerical
Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation, the exact form of the whitespace that
separates the integers does not matter.

.. warning::
    In general, Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation does not contain enough
    information to uniquely reconstruct a knot. For prime knots, both
    a knot and its reflection can be described by the same notation;
    for composite knots, the same notation can describe knots that are
    topologically inequivalent, even when allowing for reflection. If
    you need to reconstruct a knot uniquely, consider using the

This routine is an analogue to the variant of fromData() that takes
C++ initialiser lists; however, here the input data may be constructed
at runtime (which makes it accessible to Python, amongst other
things).

For the purposes of this routine, we number the crossings 1, 2, ...,
*n*. The information that you must pass to this routine is the
following:

* The first iterator range (*beginSigns*, *endSigns*) encodes the
  signs of crossings 1, ..., *n* in order. Each iterator in this range
  must dereference to either +1 or -1.

* The second iterator range (*beginComponents*, *endComponents*)
  identifies the individual components of the link. Each iterator in
  this range must dereference to a container that has a size()
  function and supports range-based ``for`` loops (so standard C++
  container classes such as std::vector<int> and std::list<int> are
  fine).

* The container for each component must be filled with integers, which
  identify the crossings you visit in order when traversing the
  component. A positive entry *i* indicates that you pass over
  crossing *i*, and a negative entry -*i* indicates that you pass
  under crossing *i*.

* To encode a component with no crossings, you may use either an empty
  container or a container containing the single integer 0.

Be aware that, once the link has been constructed, the crossings 1,
..., *n* will have been reindexed as 0, ..., *n*-1 (since every Link
object numbers its crossings starting from 0).

As an example, Python users can construct the left-hand trefoil and
the Hopf link as follows:

```
trefoil = Link.fromData([ -1, -1, -1 ], [[ 1, -2, 3, -1, 2, -3 ]])
hopf = Link.fromData([ +1, +1 ], [[ 1, -2 ], [ -1, 2 ]])

static const char *fromPD =
R"doc(Creates a new link from a planar diagram code, presented as a string.

Planar diagram codes overcome the limitations of classical Gauss codes
by encoding the local information at each crossing, though they do
introduce their own (less severe) ambiguities and computational
difficulties, as described in the warnings below. They can work with
links as well as knots, though they cannot encode zero-crossing unknot
components.

A planar diagram code for an *n*-crossing link is formed from a
sequence of *n* 4-tuples of integers. An example, you can construct
the right-handed trefoil using the sequence:

```
[[1, 5, 2, 4], [3, 1, 4, 6], [5, 3, 6, 2]]
```

See pd() for a full description of planar diagram codes (and in
particular, what these integers represent).

Regina imposes the following restrictions when reconstructing a link
from a planar diagram code:

* The integers used in the input sequence (which denote the 2*n*
  strands in the link diagram) must be in the range 1, 2, ..., 2*n*.
  That is, they cannot be arbitrary natural numbers with "gaps", and
  the numbering of strands cannot use a different starting point.

When Regina builds the resulting link, it numbers the crossings and
components (but not the strands). It will do this as follows:

* Each 4-tuple in the given sequence represents a single crossing.
  Regina will number the crossings 0, 1, ..., *n* in the same order as
  the corresponding 4-tuples appear in the sequence.

* The integers in the given sequence represent strands in the link
  diagram. The strand numbered 1 will become the starting point of
  component 0 in the final link. Of the strands not in that component,
  the lowest numbered strand remaining will become the starting point
  of component 1, and so on.

* In particular be aware that StrandRef::id() will in general have no
  relation to the strand numbers used in the planar diagram code.

There are two variants of this routine. This variant takes a single
string containing all 4*n* integers (see below for how this string may
be formatted). The other variant takes a sequence of 4-tuples of
integers, defined by a pair of iterators.

In this variant (the string variant), the integers may be separated by
any combination of the following:

* any whitespace;

* commas;

* open or close round brackets, square brackets and/or braces;

* the special symbols ``PD``, ``X``, ``Xp``, ``Xm`` and ``P``, which
  are used by other sources (such as the Knot Atlas), but which are
  ignored here.

Thus the following strings all describe the same sequence:

```
[[1, 5, 2, 4], [3, 1, 4, 6], [5, 3, 6, 2]]
PD[X[1, 5, 2, 4], X[3, 1, 4, 6], X[5, 3, 6, 2]]
1 5 2 4 3 1 4 6 5 3 6 2
```

The string may containin separators (as defined above) at the
beginning and/or the end; these will be ignored.

Note that some sources (again, such as the Knot Atlas) use the special
symbols ``Xp``, ``Xm`` and ``P`` to change the meaning of the tuples.
Regina does _not_ attribute any meaning to these symbols, and will
treat them as nothing more than separators.

    all other link components (in other words, a link components that

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Link_::gauss
static const char *gauss =
R"doc(Returns a classical Gauss code for this knot, presented as a string.

Classical Gauss codes essentially describe the 4-valent graph of a
knot but not the particular embedding in the plane. These codes come
with two major restrictions:

* In general, they do not carry enough information to uniquely
  reconstruct a knot. For instance, both a knot and its reflection can
  be described by the same Gauss code; moreover, for composite knots,
  the Gauss code can describe inequivalent knots (even when allowing
  for reflections).

* Parsing a Gauss code is complex, since it requires an embedding to
  be deduced using some variant of a planarity testing algorithm.

If you need a code that specifies the knot uniquely and/or that is
fast to parse, consider using the _oriented_ Gauss code instead, which
resolves both of these issues.

A Gauss code for an *n*-crossing knot is described by a sequence of
2*n* positive and negative integers, representing strands that pass
over and under crossings respectively. The code is constructed as
follows:

* Label the crossings arbitrarily as 1, 2, ..., *n*.

* Start at some point on the knot and follow it around. Whenever you
  pass crossing *k*, write the integer ``k`` if you pass over the
  crossing, or ``-k`` if you pass under the crossing.

As an example, you can represent the trefoil using the code:

```
1 -2 3 -1 2 -3
```

Currently Regina only supports Gauss codes for knots, not empty or
multiple component links. If this link does not have precisely one
component, then this routine will throw an exception. It is possible
that in future versions of Regina, Gauss codes will be expanded to
cover all possible link diagrams (hence the choice of NotImplemented
as the exception type).

This routine formats the list of integers as a string. The integers
will be separated by single spaces, and there will be no newlines.

format is simple. Moreover, the format is suitable for links with any
number of components.

Jenkins' format is described in his HOMFLY polynomial software, which
is available online from http://burtleburtle.net/bob/knot/homfly.html.
The format consists of a sequence of integers separated by whitespace,
constructed as follows:

* Label the crossings arbitrarily as 0, 1, ..., *n*-1.

* Write the number of components in the link.

* Next, for each link component:

  * write the number of times you pass a crossing when traversing the
    component (i.e., the length of the component);

  * write two integers for each crossing that you pass in such a
    traversal: the crossing label, and then +1 if you pass over the
    crossing or -1 if you pass under the crossing.

* Finally, for each crossing:

  * write the crossing label;

  * write the sign of the crossing (either +1 or -1).

As an example, you could describe the left-hand trefoil using the
following sequence:

```
1
6   0 1   1 -1   2 1   0 -1   1 1   2 -1
0 -1   1 -1   2 -1

2
2   0 1   1 -1
2   0 -1   1 1
0 1   1 1

See TreeDecomposition for further details on tree decompositions, and

This routine is fast: it will use a greedy algorithm to find a tree
decomposition with (hopefully) small width, but with no guarantees
that the width of this tree decomposition is the smallest possible.

The tree decomposition will be cached, so that if this routine is
called a second time (and the underlying link has not been changed)

relying on the greedy heuristics that Regina implements), then you can
supply it by calling useTreeDecomposition().

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Link_::orientedGauss
static const char *orientedGauss =
R"doc(Returns an oriented Gauss code for this knot, presented as a string.

The oriented Gauss code, based on a format used by Andreeva et al., is
an extension of the classical Gauss code with additional characters to
describe the orientation of the other strand passing by at each
crossing. This extra information removes both the topological
ambiguities and the complexity in the reconstruction procedure for
classical Gauss codes.

This "oriented" format is described at
http://www.javaview.de/services/knots/doc/description.html#gc, and it
works as follows:

* Label the crossings arbitrarily as 1, 2, ..., *n*.

* Start at some point on the knot and follow it around. At every
  crossing that you pass, write a token of the form ``+<k``, ``-<k``,
  ``+>k`` or ``->k``, where:

* the symbol ``+`` indicates that you are passing over the crossing
  labelled *k*, and the symbol ``-`` indicates that you are passing
  under the crossing labelled *k*;

* the symbol ``<`` indicates that the other strand of the crossing
  passes from right to left, and ``>`` indicates that the other strand
  passes from left to right;

* *k* is replaced with the integer crossing label.

As an example, you can represent the left-hand trefoil using the code:

```
+>1 -<2 +>3 -<1 +>2 -<3
```

Currently Regina only supports Gauss codes for knots, not empty or
multiple component links. If this link does not have precisely one
component, then this routine will throw an exception. It is possible
that in future versions of Regina, Gauss codes will be expanded to
cover all possible link diagrams (hence the choice of NotImplemented
as the exception type).

This routine joins the tokens together as a single string. The tokens
will be separated by single spaces, and there will be no newlines.

The routine orientedGaussData() returns this same data in machine-
readable format (as a C++ vector of string tokens), instead of the
human-readable format used here (a single long string). There is also
another variant of orientedGauss() that writes directly to an output
stream.

the 2*n* individual tokens of the form ``+<k``, ``-<k``, ``+>k`` or
``->k`` that would normally be joined with whitespace to form a
complete oriented Gauss code. For example, for the left-hand trefoil,
the vector might contain the six tokens:

```
{ "+>1", "-<2", "+>3", "-<1", "+>2", "-<3" }

multigraph, using the PACE text format. This text format is described
in detail at https://pacechallenge.wordpress.com/pace-2016/track-a-

In summary, the PACE text representation will consist of several lines
of text:

* The first line will be of the form ``p tw <num_vertices>
  <num_edges>``. Note that, since the underlying graph comes from a
  link diagram, we will always have *num_edges* equal to twice
  *num_vertices*.

* Following this will be *num_edges* lines, one for each edge, each of
  the form ``<u> <v>``, indicating an edge from vertex number *u* to
  vertex number *v*. In this format, vertices are numbered
  1,2,...,*num_vertices*.

An example of this text format is as follows:

```
p tw 4 8
1 2
1 4
1 2

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Link_::pd
static const char *pd =
R"doc(Returns a planar diagram code for this link, presented as a string.

Planar diagram codes encode the local information at each crossing,
and present this information as a list of 4-tuples. These codes are
available for links as well as knots, but they do come with some minor
restrictions:

* They cannot encode zero-crossing unknot components (i.e., components
  for which the component() function returns a null strand). Any such
  components will simply be omitted from the code.

* If a link has any components that consist entirely of over-crossings
  (which must be unknots "placed on top of" the link diagram), a
  planar diagram code does not carry enough data to reconstruct the
  _orientation_ of these components. The topology will be preserved,
  but in general the combinatorics of such a link diagram cannot be
  reconstructed faithfully.

If you need a text code that can work with these types of link
diagrams, you can always use Jenkins' format instead.

Regina adheres to a tight specification for the planar diagram codes
that it outputs, in order to ensure compatibility with other software.
In particular, Regina's codes are compatible with the Knot Atlas, as
seen at http://katlas.org/wiki/Planar_Diagrams.

In detail: a planar diagram code for an *n*-crossing link is formed
from a sequence of *n* 4-tuples of integers. Regina constructs this
sequence as follows:

* Throw away any zero-crossing unknot components.

* Let *n* denote the number of crossings.

* Number the strands from 1 to 2*n* in order as we walk along each
  component, in order from the first component to the last.

* For each crossing *c*, construct a 4-tuple that lists the four
  strands that meet at that *c*, in counter-clockwise order, beginning
  from the incoming lower strand.

* Return the resulting list of *n* 4-tuples.

An example, you can represent the right-hand trefoil using the code:

```
[[1, 5, 2, 4], [3, 1, 4, 6], [5, 3, 6, 2]]
```

Some points to be aware of:

* When building the list of 4-tuples, Regina orders the crossings as
  follows: again we walk along each component, in order from the first
  component to the last, and process each crossing when we enter it at
  the lower strand.

* When building each individual 4-tuple, some sources order the
  strands clockwise instead of counter-clockwise. Regina follows the
  same counter-clockwise convention that is used by the Knot Atlas and
  SnapPy.

This routine formats the list of 4-tuples as a string, in a way that
is consistent with the description in the Knot Atlas at
http://katlas.org/wiki/Planar_Diagrams.

In particular, each 4-tuple will be formatted with square brackets,
commas, and the prefix ``X``, and the main list will be formatted with
square brackets, commas, and the prefix ``PD``. An example (for the
right-handed trefoil) is:

```
PD[X[1, 5, 2, 4], X[3, 1, 4, 6], X[5, 3, 6, 2]]
```

The routine pdData() returns this same data in machine-readable format
(as a C++ vector of 4-tuples of integers), instead of the human-
readable format used here (a single string). There is also another
variant of pd() that writes directly to an output stream.

component is oriented clockwise. If *arc* is null but there is no
zero-crossing component then the move cannot be performed, and if
*arc* is null but there are multiple zero-crossing components then the
first such component will be used.

This move is almost always able to be performed: the only situation in
which it _cannot_ be performed is if *arc* is a null reference but
this link contains no zero-crossing components, as discussed above.

The location of this move is specified by the arguments *upperArc*,
*upperSide*, *lowerArc* and *lowerSide*. Specifically, this move

that the two arcs overlap. The arguments *upperSide* and *lowerSide*
indicate on which side of each arc the overlap takes place. See the
StrandRef documentation for the convention on how arcs are represented
using StrandRef objects.

If either *upperArc* or *lowerArc* is a null reference, then the move
will be performed upon a zero-crossing unknot component; it will be
assumed that this unknot component is oriented clockwise. If one of
these arguments is a null reference but there is no zero-crossing
component then the move cannot be performed, and if there are multiple
zero-crossing components then the first such component will be used.

Likewise, if _both_ arcs are null references, then the move will be
performed upon two _different_ zero-crossing unknot components. In
this case, if there are fewer than two such components then the move
cannot be performed, and otherwise *upperArc* will be the first such

    0 if the third crossing of the triangle is located to the left of
    the arc (when walking along the arc in the forward direction), or
    1 if the third crossing is located on the right of the arc.

Parameter ``check``:
    ``True`` if we are to check whether the move can be performed at
    the given location.

Parameter ``perform``:
    ``True`` if we should actually perform the move.

Returns:
    If *check* is ``True``, this function returns ``True`` if and only
    if the move can be performed. If *check* is ``False``, this
    function always returns ``True``.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Link_::r3_2
static const char *r3_2 =
R"doc(Tests for and/or performs a type III Reidemeister move.

There are two variants of this routine: one that takes an arc, and one
that takes a crossing. The other variant, which takes an arc, is more
flexible (since any of the three arcs involved in this move can be
passed). This variant, which takes a crossing, offers a canonical way
of performing the move (since for each move there is exactly one
crossing that describes it).

There are two boolean arguments that control the behaviour of this
routine: *check* and *perform*.

* If *check* and *perform* are both ``True`` (the default), then this
  routine will first check whether this move can be performed at the
  given location. If so, it will perform the move and return ``True``.
  If not, it will do nothing and return ``False``.

* If *check* is ``True`` but *perform* is ``False``, then this routine
  will simply check whether this move can be performed at the given
  location and return ``True`` or ``False`` accordingly.

* If *check* is ``False`` but *perform* is ``True``, then this routine
  will perform the move without any prior checks, and will always
  return ``True``. In this case, it must be known in advance that the
  move can be performed at the given location.

* If *check* and *perform* are both ``False``, then this routine does
  nothing and just returns ``True``. (There is no reason to use this
  combination of arguments.)

The location of this move is specified by the arguments *crossing* and
*side*. Specifically, this move takes place around a triangle, and one
of the arcs of this triangle is _uppermost_ (in that it passes above
the other two arcs). The given crossing should be the start point of
this uppermost arc; that is, when following the arc forwards,
*crossing* should be the first of the two crossings that we encounter.
The additional argument *side* indicates on which side of the
uppermost arc the third crossing is located.

You may pass a null pointer for *crossing*. However, in this case the
move cannot be performed, which means (i) *check* must be ``True``,
and therefore (ii) this routine will do nothing and return ``False``.

All crossings in this link will keep the same indices, and no
crossings will be created or destroyed. Instead, the three crossings
involved in this move will simply be reordered along the various
segments of the link.

Precondition:
    If *perform* is ``True`` but *check* is ``False``, then it must be
    known in advance that this move can be performed at the given
    location.

Precondition:
    The given crossing is either a null pointer, or else some crossing
    in this link.

Parameter ``crossing``:
    identifies the crossing at the beginning of the "uppermost" arc
    that features in this move, as described above.

Parameter ``side``:
    0 if the third crossing of the triangle is located to the left of
    the uppermost arc (when walking along the arc in the forward
    direction), or 1 if the third crossing is located on the right of
    the uppermost arc.

Parameter ``check``:
    ``True`` if we are to check whether the move can be performed at
    the given location.

Parameter ``perform``:
    ``True`` if we should actually perform the move.

Returns:
    If *check* is ``True``, this function returns ``True`` if and only
    if the move can be performed. If *check* is ``False``, this
    function always returns ``True``.)doc";

static const char *reverse =
R"doc(Reverses the orientation of every component of this link.

next()).)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Link_::rewrite
static const char *rewrite =
R"doc(Explores all knot diagrams that can be reached from this via
Reidemeister moves, without exceeding a given number of additional
crossings.

This routine is only available for knots at the present time. If this
link has multiple (or zero) components, then this routine will throw
an exception (as described below).

This routine iterates through all knot diagrams that can be reached
from this via Reidemeister moves, without ever exceeding *height*
additional crossings beyond the original number. With the current
implementation, these diagrams **could become reflected and/or
reversed**, and moreover each diagram will only be considered once up
to reflection and/or reversal; be aware that this behaviour could
change and/or become configurable in a future version of Regina.

For every such knot diagram (including this starting diagram), this
routine will call *action* (which must be a function or some other
callable object).

* *action* must take the following initial argument(s). Either (a) the
  first argument must be a link (the precise type is discussed below),
  representing the knot diagram that has been found; or else (b) the
  first two arguments must be of types const std::string& followed by
  a link, representing both the knot diagram and its knot signature.
  The second form is offered in order to avoid unnecessarily
  recomputation within the *action* function. If there are any
  additional arguments supplied in the list *args*, then these will be
  passed as subsequent arguments to *action*.

* The link argument will be passed as an rvalue; a typical action
  could (for example) take it by const reference and query it, or take
  it by value and modify it, or take it by rvalue reference and move
  it into more permanent storage.

* *action* must return a boolean. If *action* ever returns ``True``,
  then this indicates that processing should stop immediately (i.e.,
  no more knot diagrams will be processed).

* *action* may, if it chooses, make changes to this knot (i.e., the
  original knot upon which rewrite() was called). This will not affect
  the search: all knot diagrams that this routine visits will be
  obtained via Reidemeister moves from the original knot diagram,
  before any subsequent changes (if any) were made.

* *action* will only be called once for each knot diagram (including
  this starting diagram). In other words, no knot diagram will be
  revisited a second time in a single call to rewrite().

This routine can be very slow and very memory-intensive, since the
number of knot diagrams it visits may be exponential in the number of
crossings, and it records every knot diagram that it visits (so as to
avoid revisiting the same diagram again). It is highly recommended
that you begin with *height* = 1, and if necessary try increasing
*height* one at a time until this routine becomes too expensive to
run.

If *height* is negative, then there will be _no_ bound on the number
of additional crossings. This means that the routine will _never
terminate_, unless *action* returns ``True`` for some knot diagram
that is passed to it.

Since Regina 7.0, this routine will not return until the exploration
of knot diagrams is complete, regardless of whether a progress tracker
was passed. If you need the old behaviour (where passing a progress
tracker caused the enumeration to start in the background), simply
call this routine in a new detached thread.

To assist with performance, this routine can run in parallel
(multithreaded) mode; simply pass the number of parallel threads in
the argument *threads*. Even in multithreaded mode, this routine will
not return until processing has finished (i.e., either *action*
returned ``True``, or the search was exhausted). All calls to *action*
will be protected by a mutex (i.e., different threads will never be
calling *action* at the same time); as a corollary, the action should
avoid expensive operations where possible (otherwise it will become a
serialisation bottleneck in the multithreading).

Precondition:
    This link has precisely one component (i.e., it is a knot).

Exception ``FailedPrecondition``:
    This link is empty or has more than one component. If a progress
    tracker was passed, it will be marked as finished before the
    exception is thrown.

.. warning::
    The API for this class or function has not yet been finalised.
    This means that the interface may change in new versions of
    Regina, without maintaining backward compatibility. If you use
    this class directly in your own code, please check the detailed
    changelog with each new release to see if you need to make changes
    to your code.

Python:
    This function is available in Python, and the *action* argument
    may be a pure Python function. However, its form is more
    restricted: the arguments *tracker* and *args* are removed, so you
    simply call it as rewrite(height, threads, action). Moreover,
    *action* must take exactly two arguments (const std::string&,
    Link&&) representing the knot signature and the knot diagram, as
    described in option (b) above.

Parameter ``height``:
    the maximum number of _additional_ crossings to allow beyond the
    number of crossings originally present in this knot diagram, or a
    negative number if this should not be bounded.

Parameter ``threads``:
    the number of threads to use. If this is 1 or smaller then the
    routine will run single-threaded.

Parameter ``tracker``:
    a progress tracker through which progress will be reported, or
    ``None`` if no progress reporting is required.

Parameter ``action``:
    a function (or other callable object) to call for each knot
    diagram that is found.

Parameter ``args``:
    any additional arguments that should be passed to *action*,
    following the initial knot argument(s).

Returns:
    ``True`` if some call to *action* returned ``True`` (thereby
    terminating the search early), or ``False`` if the search ran to
    completion.)doc";

static const char *simplifyExhaustive =
R"doc(Attempts to simplify this knot diagram using a slow but exhaustive
search through the Reidemeister graph. This routine is more powerful
but much slower than intelligentSimplify().

Unlike intelligentSimplify(), this routine **could potentially reflect
or reverse the link**.

This routine is only available for knots at the present time. If this
link has multiple (or zero) components, then this routine will throw
an exception (as described below).

This routine will iterate through all knot diagrams that can be
reached from this via Reidemeister moves, without ever exceeding
*height* additional crossings beyond the original number.

If at any stage it finds a diagram with _fewer_ crossings than the
original, then this routine will call intelligentSimplify() to
simplify the diagram further if possible and will then return
``True``. If it cannot find a diagram with fewer crossings then it
will leave this knot diagram unchanged and return ``False``.

This routine can be very slow and very memory-intensive: the number of
knot diagrams it visits may be exponential in the number of crossings,
and it records every diagram that it visits (so as to avoid revisiting
the same diagram again). It is highly recommended that you begin with
*height* = 1, and if this fails then try increasing *height* one at a
time until either you find a simplification or the routine becomes too
expensive to run.

If *height* is negative, then there will be _no_ bound on the number
of additional crossings. This means that the routine will not
terminate until a simpler diagram is found. If no simpler diagram
exists then the only way to terminate this function is to cancel the
operation via a progress tracker (read on for details).

If you want a _fast_ simplification routine, you should call
intelligentSimplify() instead. The benefit of simplifyExhaustive() is
that, for very stubborn knot diagrams where intelligentSimplify()
finds itself stuck at a local minimum, simplifyExhaustive() is able to
"climb out" of such wells.

Since Regina 7.0, this routine will not return until either the knot
diagram is simplified or the exhaustive search is complete, regardless
of whether a progress tracker was passed. If you need the old
behaviour (where passing a progress tracker caused the exhaustive
search to start in the background), simply call this routine in a new
detached thread.

To assist with performance, this routine can run in parallel
(multithreaded) mode; simply pass the number of parallel threads in
the argument *threads*. Even in multithreaded mode, this routine will
not return until processing has finished (i.e., either the diagram was
simplified or the search was exhausted).

If this routine is unable to simplify the knot diagram, then this knot
diagram will not be changed.

Precondition:
    This link has at most one component (i.e., it is empty or it is a
    knot).

Exception ``FailedPrecondition``:
    This link has more than one component. If a progress tracker was
    passed, it will be marked as finished before the exception is
    thrown.

Python:
    The global interpreter lock will be released while this function
    runs, so you can use it with Python-based multithreading.

Parameter ``height``:
    the maximum number of _additional_ crossings to allow beyond the
    number of crossings originally present in this diagram, or a
    negative number if this should not be bounded.

Parameter ``threads``:
    the number of threads to use. If this is 1 or smaller then the
    routine will run single-threaded.

Parameter ``tracker``:
    a progress tracker through which progress will be reported, or
    ``None`` if no progress reporting is required.

Returns:
    ``True`` if and only if this diagram was successfully simplified
    to fewer crossings.)doc";

static const char *simplifyToLocalMinimum =
R"doc(Uses type I and II Reidemeister moves to reduce the link monotonically

End users will probably not want to call this routine. You should call
intelligentSimplify() if you want a fast (and usually effective) means
of simplifying a link. If this link is a knot (i.e., it has precisely
one component), then you can also call simplifyExhaustive() if you are
still stuck and you want to try a slower but more powerful method
instead.

Type III Reidemeister moves (which do not reduce the number of
crossings) are not used in this routine. Such moves do however feature
in intelligentSimplify().

This routine will never reflect or reverse the link.

crossing number *k* of some other link, then the return value will
refer to the same strand (upper or lower) of crossing number *k* of
this link.

This routine behaves correctly even if *other* is a null reference.

Precondition:

For some link routines, including niceTreeDecomposition() as well as
computations such as jones() that support the option ALG_TREEWIDTH,
Regina needs a tree decomposition of the planar 4-valent multigraph
formed by this link diagram.

By default, Regina will compute (and then cache) such a tree
decomposition itself, using in-built greedy heuristics. This routine
allows you to supply your _own_ tree decomposition (which, for
example, might be a smaller-width tree decomposition that you found
using third-party software). By supplying your own tree decomposition
*td* through this routine, Regina will throw away any pre-computed
tree decomposition that it has cached, and will instead cache *td* for
future use instead.

Regina may modify the given tree decomposition for its purposes. In
particular, *td* does not need to be a _nice_ tree decomposition
(indeed, it does not need to have any special properties beyond the
definition of a tree decomposition). Regina will automatically create

In this version of writheOfComponent(), the component is indicated by
the argument *strand*, which may be any strand along the component. In
particular, *strand* does not need to be the "starting strand"
returned by component().

The given strand may be a null strand, in which case the return value
will be 0 (since Regina uses null strands to refer to zero-crossing
unknot components). This is always allowed, regardless of whether the
