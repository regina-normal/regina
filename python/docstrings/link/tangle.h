// Docstring regina::python::doc::Tangle
static const char *Tangle =
R"doc(Represents a 2-tangle in the 3-ball. Regina does not allow closed
components in a tangle; in other words, a tangle in Regina is a proper
embedding of exactly two arcs in the 3-ball with the corresponding
four endpoints attached to four marked points on the 3-ball boundary.

Regina stores tangles as projections, with the four endpoints fixed at
the top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right corners of the
diagram.

Each tangles has a _type_, indicating how the four endpoints are
connected. The three possible types are:

* _horizontal_, indicating that the two top endpoints are connected,
  and the two bottom endpoints are connected;

* _vertical_, indicating that the two left endpoints are connected,
  and the two right endpoints are connected;

* _diagonal_, indicating that the top-left and bottom-right endpoints
  are connected, and the bottom-left and top-right endpoints are
  connected.

Internally, Regina numbers the two strings 0 and 1: string 0 will
always be the one attached to the top-left endpoint. Regina also
assigns each string an orientation: for a horizontal or diagonal
tangle this will always be from left to right, and for a vertical
tangle this will always be from top to bottom.

When traversing a tangle, if you reach one of the endpoints of a
string then the corresponding return value of Crossing::next() or
Crossing::prev() (whichever is relevant) will be a null strand
reference.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Tangle_::brief
static const char *brief =
R"doc(Outputs this tangle in Regina's own brief write-only format. This
format is concise, but contains enough information to manually
reconstruct the complete tangle.

This format cannot (yet) be used to read tangles back into Regina, and
so it is not good for external storage, or for passing tangles between
different programs (or even different instances of Regina). It was
originally designed for use with the test suite, where it was used to
ensure that tangles with being created and/or manipulated correctly.

The output will contain the following elements, separated by single
spaces:

* one of the symbols ``-``, ``|`` or ``x``, indicating that the tangle
  is of horizontal, vertical or diagonal type respectively (as
  described in the class notes);

* a sequence of signs (``+`` or ``-``), concatenated together, giving
  the signs of the crossings in order from crossing 0 to crossing
  size()-1;

* a description of string 0 and then string 1. Each string will be
  written in the form ``( a b c ... )``, indicating the crossings that
  are encountered as we follow the string in the forward direction
  from its starting endpoint. Each element *a*, *b*, *c* and so on
  will be written in the format used by the StrandRef class: either
  ``^n`` when passing over crossing *n*, or ``_n`` when passing under
  crossing *n*.

For example, the rational tangle 3/2 as returned by Tangle(3,2) will
give the following brief output:

```
| --+ ( _0 ^1 ) ( ^2 _1 ^0 _2 )
```

As a special case, if the tangle contains no crossings then the output
will contain just one space, not two consecutive spaces, between the
type symbol and the string descriptions (since the sequence of
crossing signs that would normally sit between them will be empty).

The string will not end in a newline.

There is also a variant of brief() that writes directly to an output
stream.

.. warning::
    If some crossings are added or removed then the indices of other
    crossings might change. If you wish to track a particular crossing
    through such operations then you should use the pointer to the

Parameter ``index``:
    the index of the requested crossing. This must be between 0 and

    the crossing at the given index.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Tangle_::crossings
static const char *crossings =
R"doc(Returns an object that allows iteration through and random access to
all crossings within this tangle.

The object that is returned is lightweight, and can be happily copied
by value. The C++ type of the object is subject to change, so C++
users should use ``auto`` (just like this declaration does).

The returned object is guaranteed to be an instance of ListView, which
means it offers basic container-like functions and supports range-
based ``for`` loops. Note that the elements of the list will be
pointers, so your code might look like:

```
for (Crossing* c : tangle.crossings()) { ... }
```

The object that is returned will remain up-to-date and valid for as
long as the tangle exists: even as crossings are added and/or removed,
it will always reflect the crossings that are currently in the tangle.
Nevertheless, it is recommended to treat this object as temporary
only, and to call crossings() again each time you need it.

right for a horizontal or diagonal tangle, and from top-to-bottom for
a vertical tangle.

Parameter ``string``:
    indicates which of the two strings in this tangle to query; this
    must be either 0 or 1.

Returns:
    the crossing closest to the end of the given string, or a null
    reference if the given string contains no crossings.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::Tangle_::fromOrientedGauss
static const char *fromOrientedGauss =
R"doc(Creates a new tangle from an oriented Gauss code.

Oriented Gauss codes for tangles are an extension of oriented Gauss
codes for knots. Whilst oriented Gauss codes for knots are used
elsewhere (they are based on a format used by Andreeva et al.), these
codes for tangles are specific to Regina (so you should not expect
other software to understand them).

The format works as follows:

* Label the crossings arbitrarily as 1, 2, ..., *n*.

* Write one of the tokens ``-``, ``|`` or ``x`` to represent a
  horizontal, vertical or diagonal tangle respectively.

* Start at the top-left endpoint and follow this string to its other
  endpoint. At every crossing that you pass, write a token of the form
  ``+<k``, ``-<k``, ``+>k`` or ``->k``, where:

* the symbol ``+`` indicates that you are passing over the crossing
  labelled *k*, and the symbol ``-`` indicates that you are passing
  under the crossing labelled *k*;

* the symbol ``<`` indicates that the other strand of the crossing
  passes from right to left, and ``>`` indicates that the other strand
  passes from left to right;

* *k* is replaced with the integer crossing label.

* Write the token ``_`` to indicate that the first string has
  finished.

* Start at the beginning of the other string (for horizontal or
  diagonal tangles, this is the bottom-left endpoint, and for vertical
  tangles this is the top-right endpoint). As before, follow this
  string to its other endpoint, writing a token of the form ``+<k``,
  ``-<k``, ``+>k`` or ``->k`` at every crossing that you pass.

Be aware that, once the tangle has been constructed, the crossings 1,
..., *n* will have been reindexed as 0, ..., *n*-1 (since every Tangle
object numbers its crossings starting from 0).

As an example, you can construct the rational tangle -3/4 using the
following code:

```
| -<1 +>2 -<3 +>4 _ -<5 -<4 +>3 -<2 +>1 +>5
```

There are two variants of this routine. This variant takes a single
string, where the tokens have been combined together and separated by
whitespace. The other variant takes a sequence of tokens, defined by a
pair of iterators.

In this variant (the string variant), the given string may contain
additional leading or trailing whitespace.

.. warning::
    While this routine does some error checking on the input, these
    checks are not exhaustive. In particular, it does _not_ test for
    the viability of the diagram (i.e., whether the given crossings
    with the given signs actually produce a tangle of the given type
    with the correct endpoints). Of course non-viable inputs are not
    allowed, and it is currently up to the user to enforce this.
