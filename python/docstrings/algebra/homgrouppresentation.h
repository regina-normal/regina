// Docstring regina::python::doc::HomGroupPresentation
static const char *HomGroupPresentation =
R"doc(Represents a homomorphism between groups which are described via
finite presentations.

Some homomorphisms may be _declared isomorphisms_. This means that the
user (or some other function in Regina) has proven that this is an
isomorphism and has explicitly provided the inverse map. To provide
the inverse map, you should call the four-argument constructor
HomGroupPresentation(const GroupPresentation&, const
GroupPresentation&, const std::vector<GroupExpression>&, const
std::vector<GroupExpression>&).

You can test for a declared isomorphism by calling knowsInverse().
Even if a homomorphism is not a declared isomorphism, it might still
be an isomorphism; this just means that no inverse map was explicitly
provided.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.

.. warning::
    The API for this class or function has not yet been finalised.
    This means that the interface may change in new versions of
    Regina, without maintaining backward compatibility. If you use
    this class directly in your own code, please check the detailed
    changelog with each new release to see if you need to make changes
    to your code.)doc";

This routine does _not_ test whether the two homomorphisms are equal
in the sense that each element of the domain maps to the same group
element of the codomain - in general this is an undecidable problem.

Instead, this routine tests whether the two homomorphisms map the
*i*th generator of the domain to precisely the same _word_ in the
codomain, for each *i*.

This routine will not test whether the domains and codomains have
identical presentations, or whether either homomorphism is declared to
be an isomorphism. However, if the two domains have different numbers
of generators then the two homomorphisms will compare as not equal
(since it will be impossible to compare the words that the
corresponding generators map to).

runs through all the relators in the domain, evaluates the
homomorphism on the relators and checks that they simplify to 1 in the
codomain.

This routine does not guarantee a conclusive result (since the word
problem is, in general, undecidable). If this routine returns ``True``
then this proves that the homomorphism is indeed valid. If this
routine returns ``False``, then the result is inconclusive (i.e., it
might still be valid but Regina was not able to prove this).

This routine is intended for sanity checking only: any homomorphism
that you construct in Regina should always be valid in this sense.

isomorphism.

This routine works by attempting to verify that ``f^-1(f(x))x^-1``
simplifes to 1 for all generators *x* in the domain, and likewise for
the codomain.

This routine does not guarantee a conclusive result. If this routine
returns ``True`` then this proves that this is indeed an isomorphism.
If this routine returns ``False`` then the result is inconclusive
(i.e., it might still be an isomorphism but Regina was not able to
prove this).

You probably only want to run this on good presentations for small
cancellation theory - an automorphism of a poorly-presented group
likely will not be noticed.

This routine is intended for sanity checking only: any homomorphism
that you construct as a declared isomorphism should always be an
isomorphism.

Precondition:
    This homomorphism is in fact a declared isomorphism. See the
    HomGroupPresentation class notes for details on what this means.

Returns:
    ``True`` if it is verified that this is an isomorphism, or
    ``False`` if the result is inconclusive.)doc";
