  then these will be passed as subsequent arguments to *action*.

* *action* must return ``void``.

* It is completely safe for *action* to (if you wish) make changes to
  the original presentation (i.e., the group presentation upon which
  enumerateCovers() is being called). This will not interfere with the
  enumeration or change the results in any way.

This routine produces a constant stream of output (i.e., it calls
*action* as soon as each representation is found).

.. warning::
    The running time is ``(k!)^g``, where *k* is the subgroup index
    described above, and *g* is the number of generators of this group
    presentation. In particular, the running time grows _extremely_
    quickly with *k*. Moreover, for larger indices this routine may
    precompute some tables that will never be released (but which only
    need to be computed the first time that index is used); for index
    10 these tables will consume roughly 30MB, and for index 11 they
    will consume around 320MB.

.. warning::
    This routine does _not_ simplify the group presentation before it
    runs. You should make sure that you have simplified the
    presentation, either using Regina or some other tool, before
    running this routine, since (as noted above) the running time is
    exponential in the number of generators.

.. warning::
    Likewise, this routine does not simplify the subgroup
    presentations before passing them to *action*. These presentations
    can be quite large, and (for example) if all you care about is
    their abelianisations then you are better off using the _abelian_
    group simplification / computation instead (which is much faster).

Precondition:
    Arrays on this system can be large enough to store ``2⋅(n-2)!``
    objects. This is a technical condition on the bit-size of
    ``size_t`` that will be explicitly checked (with an exception
    thrown if it fails). On a 64-bit system this condition will be
    true for all supported *n*, but on a 32-bit system or smaller it
    will mean that enumerateCovers() cannot be used for larger values
    of *n*.

Exception ``FailedPrecondition``:
    A signed integer of the same bit-size as ``size_t`` cannot hold
    ``2⋅(n-2)!``. See the precondition above for further discussion on
    this constraint.

.. warning::
    The API for this class or function has not yet been finalised.
    This means that the interface may change in new versions of
    Regina, without maintaining backward compatibility. If you use
    this class directly in your own code, please check the detailed
    changelog with each new release to see if you need to make changes
    to your code.

Python:
    There are two versions of this function available in Python. The
    first form is ``enumerateCovers(index, action)``, which mirrors
    the C++ function: it takes *action* which may be a pure Python
    function, it returns the number of representations found, but it
    does _not_ take an addition argument list (*args*). The second
    form is ``enumerateCovers(index)``, which returns a Python list
    containing all of the corresponding subgroups, each given as a
    GroupPresentation. In both forms, the template parameter *index*
    becomes the first argument to the Python function.

Template parameter ``index``:
    the number *k* in the description above; in other words, the index
    of the resulting subgroups. Currently this must be between 2 and
    11 inclusive; this range is limited because some of the cached
    precomputations can consume a _lot_ of space for larger indices.

Parameter ``action``:
    a function (or other callable object) to call for each
    representation that is found.

Parameter ``args``:
    any additional arguments that should be passed to *action*,
    following the initial subgroup presentation argument.

Returns:
    the total number of representations found.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::GroupPresentation_::gap
static const char *gap =
R"doc(Returns a sequence of GAP commands that create this group.

GAP is a widely-used computational algebra system, and can be
downloaded from http://gap-system.org/ .

Other than the variable for the group itself, the commands returned
will not use or modify any other GAP variables with the current GAP
scope.

The string that is returned will be presented as a single (possibly
very long) GAP function call, and will not contain any newlines.

Parameter ``groupVariable``:
    the name of the GAP variable to which this group will be assigned.

Returns:
    a sequence of commands to create this group in GAP.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::GroupPresentation_::global_swap
static const char *global_swap =
R"doc(Swaps the contents of the two given group presentations.

This global routine simply calls GroupPresentation::swap(); it is
provided so that GroupPresentation meets the C++ Swappable
requirements.

Parameter ``lhs``:
    the presentation whose contents should be swapped with *rhs*.

Parameter ``rhs``:
    the presentation whose contents should be swapped with *lhs*.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::GroupPresentation_::homologicalAlignment
static const char *homologicalAlignment =
R"doc(Rewrites the presentation so that generators of the group map to
generators of the abelianisation, with any left-over generators
mapping to zero (if possible). Consider this a _homological-alignment_
of the presentation.

If the abelianisation of this group has rank *N* and *M* invariant
factors ``d0 | d2 | ... | d(M-1)``, this routine applies Nielsen moves
to the presentation to ensure that under the markedAbelianisation()
routine, generators 0 through *M*-1 are mapped to generators of the
relevant ``Z_di`` group. Similarly, generators *M* through *M*+*N*-1
are mapped to ±1 in the appropriate factor. All further generators
will be mapped to zero.

If this routine does return a homomorphism (because the presentation
was changed), then this homomorphsm will in fact be a declared
isomorphism. See the HomGroupPresentation class notes for details on
what this means.

.. note::
    If you all care about is whether the presentation changed, you can
    simply cast the return value to a ``bool``. This will then mirror
    the behaviour of homologicalAlignment() from Regina 6.0 and
    earlier, when the return type was simply ``bool``.

Returns:
    an isomorphism describing the reduction map from the original
    presentation to the new presentation, or ``None`` if this
    presentation was not changed.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::GroupPresentation_::identifyAbelian
static const char *identifyAbelian =
R"doc(Attempts to determine if the group is abelian.

A return value of ``True`` indicates that this routine successfully
certified that the group is abelian. A return value of ``False``
indicates an inconclusive result: either the group is non-abelian, or
the group is abelian but this routine could not prove so.

If the group is abelian, then markedAbelianization() is the easiest
way to see precisely which abelian group it is, and how the generators
sit in that group.

You will have better results from this algorithm if the presentation
has been simplified, since this algorithm uses small cancellation
theory in an attempt to reduce the commutators of all pairs of
generators.

.. warning::
    If you have not adequately simplified this presentation this
    routine will most likely return ``False``. Consider running
    intelligentSimplify, possibly in concert with
    proliferateRelators(), in order to discover adequately many
    commutators.

Returns:
    ``True`` if the group is shown to be abelian, or ``False`` if the
    result is inconclusive.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::GroupPresentation_::identifySimplyIsomorphicTo
static const char *identifySimplyIsomorphicTo =
R"doc(Attempts to prove that this and the given group presentation are
_simply isomorphic_.

A _simple isomorphism_ is an isomorphism where each generator *g_{i}*
of this presentation is sent to some generator *g_{j}*^{±1} of the
other presentation. Moreover, at present this routine only looks for
maps where both presentations have the same number of generators, and
where distinct generators *g_{i}* of this presentation correspond to
distinct generators *g_{j}* of the other presentation (possibly with
inversion, as noted above).

If this routine returns ``True``, it means that the two presentations
are indeed simply isomorphic.

If this routine returns ``False``, it could mean one of many things:

* The groups are not isomorphic;

* The groups are isomorphic, but not simply isomorphic;

* The groups are simply isomorphic but this routine could not prove
  it, due to difficulties with the word problem.

Parameter ``other``:
    the group presentation to compare with this.

Returns:
    ``True`` if this routine could certify that the two group
    presentations are simply isomorphic, or ``False`` if it could not.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::GroupPresentation_::incidence
static const char *incidence =
R"doc(Returns a matrix indicating which generators are used by which
relations.

The rows of the matrix correspond to the relations 0,1,..., and the
columns correspond to the generators 0,1,.... The matrix entry in row
*r*, column *g* will be ``True`` if and only if relation *r* uses
generator *g*.

Precondition:
    The numbers of generators and relations are both non-zero.

Returns:
    the incidence matrix between relators and generators.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::GroupPresentation_::intelligentNielsen
static const char *intelligentNielsen =
R"doc(Looks for Nielsen moves that will simplify the presentation. Performs
one of the most-effective moves, if it can find any.

what this means.

This routine is guaranteed to be deterministic: within the same
version of Regina, simplifying identical group presentations will give
identical results. These results could, however, change between
different versions of Regina.

.. note::
    If you all care about is whether the presentation changed, you can
    simply cast the return value to a ``bool``. This will then mirror
    the behaviour of intelligentNielsen() from Regina 6.0 and earlier,

Returns:
    an isomorphism describing the map from the original presentation
    to the new presentation, or ``None`` if this presentation was not
    changed.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::GroupPresentation_::intelligentSimplify
static const char *intelligentSimplify =
R"doc(Attempts to simplify the group presentation as intelligently as
possible without further input.

The current simplification method uses a combination of small

static const char *isValid =
R"doc(Tests whether all of the relations for the group are indeed words in
the generators. This routine returns ``False`` if at least one relator
uses an out-of-bound generator, and ``True`` otherwise.

This routine is intended only for sanity checking: you should never
have an invalid group presentation in the first place.

    ``True`` if and only if all of the relations are words in the
    generators.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::GroupPresentation_::markedAbelianisation
static const char *markedAbelianisation =
R"doc(Computes the abelianisation of this group. The coordinates in the
chain complex correspond to the generators and relators for this

// Docstring regina::python::doc::GroupPresentation_::nielsenCombine
static const char *nielsenCombine =
R"doc(Replaces a generator ``gi`` by either ``(gi)(gj)^k`` or ``(gj)^k(gi)``
in the presentation. It it is the third type of Nielsen move one can
apply to a presentation.

This means that, if the new generator ``Gi`` is the old ``(gi)(gj)^k``
or ``(gj)^k(gi)``, then we can construct the new presentation from the
old by replacing occurrences of ``Gi`` by ``(Gi)(gj)^(-k)`` or
``(gj)^(-k)(Gi)`` respectively.

Precondition:
    Both *i* and *j* are strictly less than countGenerators().

Parameter ``i``:
    indicates the generator to replace.

Parameter ``j``:
    indicates the generator to combine with ``gi``.

Parameter ``k``:
    indicates the power to which we raise ``gj`` when performing the
    replacement; this may be positive or negative (or zero, but this
    will have no effect).

Parameter ``rightMult``:
    ``True`` if we should replace ``gi`` by ``(gi)(gj)^k``, or
    ``False`` if we should replace ``gi`` by ``(gj)^k(gi)``.

1. If there are any length 1 relators, those generators are deleted,

2. It sorts the relators by number of generator indices that appear,
   followed by relator numbers (lexico) followed by relator length.

3. It inverts relators if the net sign of the generators is negative.

4. Given each generator, it looks for the smallest word where that
   generator appears with non-zero weight. If negative weight, it

// Docstring regina::python::doc::GroupPresentation_::proliferateRelators
static const char *proliferateRelators =
R"doc(A routine to help escape local wells when simplifying presentations,
which may be useful when small cancellation theory can't find the
simplest relators.

Given a presentation ``<g_i | r_i>``, this routine appends
consequences of the relators {r_i} to the presentation that are of the
form ab, where both a and b are cyclic permutations of relators from
the collection {r_i}.

Passing depth=1 means it will only form products of two relators.
Depth=2 means products of three, etc. Depth=4 is typically the last
depth before the exponential growth of the operation grows out of
hand. It also conveniently trivializes all the complicated trivial
group presentations that we've come across so far.

.. warning::
    Do not call this routine with depth n before having called it at
    depth n-1 first. Depth=0 is invalid, and depth=1 should be your
    first call to this routine. This routine gobbles up an exponential
    amount of memory (exponential in your presentation size times n).
    So do be careful when using it.

Parameter ``depth``:
    controls the depth of the proliferation, as described above; this
    must be strictly positive.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::GroupPresentation_::recogniseGroup
static const char *recogniseGroup =
R"doc(Attempts to recognise the group corresponding to this presentation.
This routine is much more likely to be successful if you have already
called intelligentSimplify().

Currently, the groups this routine recognises include: the trivial
group, abelian groups, free groups, extensions over the integers, and
free products of any group the algorithm can recognise (inductively).

The string returned from this routine may use some unicode characters,
which will be encoding using UTF-8. If *moreUtf8* is passed as
``False`` then unicode will be used sparingly; if *moreUtf8* is
``True`` then unicode will be use more liberally, resulting in strings
that look nicer but require more complex fonts to be available on the
user's machine.

Examples of the format of the returned string are:

* ``0`` for the trivial group;

* ``Z_n`` for cyclic groups with *n* > 1;

* ``Free(n)`` for free groups with *n* > 1 generators - see
  AbelianGroup::str() for how abelian groups are presented;

* ``FreeProduct(G1, G2, ... , Gk)`` for free products, where one
  replaces *G1* through *Gk* by text strings representing the free
  summands;

* ``Z~G w/ monodromy H`` for extensions over Z, where *G* is a
  description of the kernel of the homomorphism to the integers, and
  *H* is a text string representing the monodromy - see
  HomMarkedAbelianGroup.str() for details on how these are presented.

then this routine might (as part of the reduction process) transform
*w* into a different group element of the form ``g w g^-1``.

In Regina 7.2 and earlier, this routine was called simplifyWord(). It
was renamed to simplifyAndConjugate() in Regina 7.3 to make it clear
to the user that conjugation might take place. Note that, even in
older versions of Regina, this routine could always potentially
conjugate.

    You might want to consider running intelligentSimplify(), possibly
    in concert with proliferateRelators(), before using this routine
    for any significant tasks.

static const char *smallCancellation =
R"doc(Attempts to simplify the group presentation using small cancellation
theory. The simplification method is based on the Dehn algorithm for
hyperbolic groups, i.e. small cancellation theory. This means we look

presentation-shortening substitutions are available. We follow that by
killing any available generators using words where generators appear a
single time.
