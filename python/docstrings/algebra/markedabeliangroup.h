// Docstring regina::python::doc::HomMarkedAbelianGroup
static const char *HomMarkedAbelianGroup =
R"doc(Represents a homomorphism of finitely generated abelian groups.

One initializes such a homomorphism by providing:

* two finitely generated abelian groups, which act as domain and
  codomain;

* a matrix describing the linear map between the free abelian groups
  in the centres of the respective chain complexes that were used to
  define the domain and codomain. If the abelian groups are computed
  via homology with coefficients, the codomain coefficients must be a
  quotient of the domain coefficients.

So for example, if the domain was initialized by the chain complex
``Z^a --A--> Z^b --B--> Z^c`` with mod p coefficients, and the
codomain was initialized by ``Z^d --D--> Z^e --E--> Z^f`` with mod q
coefficients, then the matrix needs to be an e-by-b matrix.
Furthermore, you only obtain a well-defined homomorphism if this
matrix extends to a cycle map, which this class assumes but which the
user can confirm with isCycleMap(). Moreover, *q* should divide *p:*
this allows for *q* > 0 and *p* = 0, which means the domain has Z
coefficients and the codomain has mod *q* coefficients.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.

// Docstring regina::python::doc::MarkedAbelianGroup
static const char *MarkedAbelianGroup =
R"doc(Represents a finitely generated abelian group given by a chain
complex.

This class is initialized with a chain complex. The chain complex is
given in terms of two integer matrices *M* and *N* such that M×N=0.
These matrices should be thought of as acting on column vectors: this
means for example that the product ``B×A`` applies the linear
transformation *A*, then the linear transformation *B*. This is
consistent with the convention that Regina uses for for multiplying
permutations.

The abelian group that this class computes is the kernel of *M* modulo
the image of *N*. In other words, we compute the homology of the chain
complex ``Z^a --N--> Z^b --M--> Z^c``, where *a* = N.columns(), *b* =
M.columns() = N.rows(), and *c* = M.rows(). An additional constructor
allows you to take the homology with coefficients in an arbitrary
cyclic group.

Like the simpler class AbelianGroup, this group will be isomorphic to
some ``Z_{d0} + ... + Z_{dk} + Z^r``, where:

* *r* is the number of free generators, as returned by rank();

* *d1*, ..., *dk* are the _invariant factors_ that describe the
  torsion elements of the group, where 1 < *d1* | *d2* | ... | *dk*.

This class allows you to retrieve the invariant factors, the rank, and
the corresponding vectors in the kernel of *M*. Moreover, given a
vector in the kernel of *M*, it decribes the homology class of the
vector (the free part, and its position in the invariant factors).

The purpose of this class is to not just represent homology groups,
but also to support coordinates on the group allowing for the
construction of homomorphisms, and keeping track of subgroups.

This routine makes frequent use of two coordinate systems:

* _Chain complex coordinates_ describe vectors of length *b* (using
  the notation above); that is, elements of the domain of *M*, or
  equivalently the codomain of *N*.

* _SNF (or Smith normal form) coordinates_ describe elements of this
  abelian group in terms of the torsion and free generators. A vector
  in SNF coordinates has length (*k* + *r*), again using the notation
  above, where the first *k* elements store coefficients for the
  generators of the torsion components Z_{d1}, ..., Z_{dk}, and the
  remaining *r* elements store coefficients for the *r* free
  generators. You can see how the torsion and free generators appear
  in chain complex coordinates by calling torsionRep() or freeRep()
  respectively.

Be aware that the choice of torsion and free generators is typically
not unique, and this will affect the results of many member functions
of this class. These choices are subject to change between different
versions of Regina; in particular, they depend upon the particular
algorithm used for computing Smith normal forms.

Some routines in this class refer to the _internal presentation
matrix_. This is a proper presentation matrix for the abelian group;
if you are looking at the implementation details, this refers to the
matrix *pres*, created by taking the product ``MRi_ * N`` and then
removing the first *rankM_* rows.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.

that indicates where the generators are sent. The roles of the two

HomMarkedAbelianGroup class overview.

The matrix must be given in the chain-complex coordinates.
Specifically, if the domain was defined via the chain complex ``Z^a
--N1--> Z^b --M1--> Z^c`` and the codomain was defined via ``Z^d

describes a homomorphism from Z^b to Z^e.

In order for this to make sense as a homomorphism of the groups
represented by the domain and codomain respectively, one requires
``img(mat×N1)`` to be a subset of img(N2). Similarly, ker(M1) must be
sent into ker(M2). These facts are not checked, but are assumed as
preconditions of this constructor.

This routine takes a single argument *cycle*, which should be a cycle

a full explanation of what these concepts mean.

In the vector that is returned, the coordinates that hold coefficients
for the torsion generators will be non-negative integers modulo the
corresponding invariant factors *d1*, ..., *dk*.

Specifically, using the notation from the class notes, suppose *cycle*
belongs to ker(*M*) and snfRep(*cycle*) returns the vector (*b1*, ...,
*bk*, *a1*, ..., *ar*). Suppose furthermore that the free generators
returned by freeRep(0..(r-1)) are *f1*, ..., *fr* respectively, and
that the torsion generators returned by torsionRep(0..(k-1)) are *t1*,
..., *tk* respectively. Then *cycle* = *b1*.t1 + ... + *bk*.tk +
*a1*.f1 + ... + *ar*.fr modulo img(*N*).
