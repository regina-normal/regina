// Docstring regina::python::doc::TreeBag
static const char *TreeBag =
R"doc(Represents a single bag in a tree decomposition.

The class TreeDecomposition is used to build, manipulate and iterate
over tree decompositions of graphs. A tree decomposition of a graph
*G* consists of (i) an underlying tree *T*; and (ii) a _bag_ at every
node of this tree. Each bag is a set of zero or more nodes of *G*, and
these bags are subject to various constraints as described in the
TreeDecomposition class notes.

In Regina, the underlying tree *T* is a rooted tree, so that every
non-root bag has exactly one parent bag, and every bag has some number
of children (possibly many, possibly zero).

This class TreeBag represents a single bag in a tree decomposition.

* You can query which nodes of *G* the bag contains through the member
  functions size(), element() and contains(). It is assumed that the
  nodes of *G* are numbered 0,1,2,..., and so the nodes stored in this
  bag are simply represented as integers.

* You can query the location of the bag in the underlying tree *T*
  through the member functions parent(), children(), sibling() and
  isLeaf().

* You can iterate through all the bags in the tree decomposition with
  the help of member functions next(), nextPrefix() and index().

* If the tree decomposition is of a special type (such as a _nice_
  tree decomposition), then each bag may be adorned with some
  additional information; you can access this through the member
  functions type() and subtype().

To _build_ a tree decomposition of a graph, see the various
TreeDecomposition class constructors.

Note that a bag may be empty (indeed, if you call
TreeDecomposition::makeNice() then it is guaranteed that the root bag
will be empty).

Tree bags do not support value semantics: they cannot be copied,
swapped, or manually constructed. Their location in memory defines
them, and they are often passed and compared by pointer. End users are
never responsible for their memory management; this is all taken care
of by the TreeDecomposition to which they belong.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::TreeDecomposition
static const char *TreeDecomposition =
R"doc(Represents a tree decomposition of a graph.

Whilst this class can be used to build tree decompositions of
arbitrary graphs, it also offers a simple interface for building a
tree decomposition of the facet pairing graph of a given
triangulation. This is an important step in the implementation of
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms on triangulated manifolds.

Given a graph *G*, a tree decomposition of *G* consists of (i) an
underlying tree *T*; and (ii) a _bag_ at every node of this tree. Each
bag is a set of zero or more nodes of *G*, and these bags are subject
to the following constraints:

* Every node of *G* belongs to some bag;

* Every arc of *G* has both its endpoints in some common bag;

* For every node *v* of *G*, the set of _all_ bags containing *v*
  forms a (connected) subtree of *T*.

In Regina, the underlying tree *T* is a rooted tree, so that every
non-root bag has exactly one parent bag, and every bag has some number
of children (possibly many, possibly zero).

Tree decompositions are generally considered "better" if their bags
are smaller (i.e., contain fewer nodes of *G*). To this end, the
_width_ of a tree decomposition is one less than its largest bag size,
and the _treewidth_ of *G* is the minimum width over all tree
decompositions of *G*.

A tree decomposition is described by a single TreeDecomposition
object, and the class TreeBag is used to represent each individual
bag.

* You can build a tree decomposition using the various
  TreeDecomposition constructors, and manipulate it using member
  functions such as compress() and makeNice().

* To iterate through the bags of the tree decomposition, you can use
  TreeDecomposition::first() and TreeBag::next() (for a postfix
  iteration), or you can use TreeDecomposition::firstPrefix() and
  TreeBag::nextPrefix() (for a prefix iteration).

The bags themselves are stored as sets of integers: it is assumed that
the nodes of *G* are numbered 0,1,2,..., and so the bags simply store
the numbers of the nodes that they contain.

This class also numbers its bags 0,1,...,size()-1 in a leaves-to-root,
left-to-right manner:

* for each non-root bag *b*, the parent of *b* will have a higher
  index than *b*;

* for each bag *b* with a next sibling, the next sibling of *b* will
  have a higher index than *b*.

This bag numbering may be useful if you wish to store auxiliary
information alongside each bag in a separate array. You can access
this numbering through the function TreeBag::index(). However, note
that TreeDecomposition does _not_ store its bags in an array, and so
the "random access" function bag() is slow, with worst-case linear
time.

There are two broad classes of algorithms for building tree
decompositions: (i) _exact_ algorithms, which are slow but guarantee
to find a tree decomposition of the smallest possible width; and (ii)
_greedy_ algorithms, which are fast and which aim to keep the width
small but which do not promise minimality. Currently Regina only
offers greedy algorithms, though this may change in a future release.
See the TreeDecompositionAlg enumeration for a list of all algorithms
that are currently available.

Note that individual bags are allowed to be empty. Moreover, if the
underlying graph *G* is empty then the tree decomposition may contain
no bags at all.

This class implements C++ move semantics and adheres to the C++
Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep copies wherever
possible, even when passing or returning objects by value.)doc";

* The remaining *num_bags* - 1 non-comment lines should indicate the
  connections between the bags in the tree decomposition. Each such
  line should be of the form ``<first_bag_index> <second_bag_index>``,
  where *first_bag_index* is smaller than *second_bag_index*.

Bags may be empty, but there must be at least one bag, and the
connections between the bags must form a tree. This routine will
choose the root of the tree arbitrarily.

An example of this text format is as follows:

```
c A tree decomposition with 4 bags and width 2
s td 4 3 5
b 1 1 2 3
b 2 2 3 4
b 3 3 4 5
b 4
1 2
2 3
2 4
```

There are two variants of this routine. This variant contains a single
string containing the entire text representation. The other variant
takes an input stream, from which the text representation will be
read.

.. warning::
    While this routine does some basic error checking on the input,
    this checking is not exhaustive; in particular, it does not verify
    that the connections between bags actually form a tree.

Exception ``InvalidArgument``:
    The input was not a valid representation of a tree decomposition
    using the PACE text format. As noted above, the checks performed
    here are not exhaustive.

Parameter ``str``:
    a text representation of the tree decomposition using the PACE
    text format.

Returns:
    the corresponding tree decomposition.

requirements.

// Docstring regina::python::doc::TreeDecomposition_::makeNice
static const char *makeNice =
R"doc(Converts this into a nice tree decomposition.

A _nice_ tree decomposition is one in which every bag is one of the
following types:

* an _introduce_ bag, which has only one child bag, and which contains
  all of the nodes in this child bag plus exactly one new node (and
  nothing else);

* a _forget_ bag, which has only one child bag, and which contains all
  of the nodes in this child bag except for exactly one missing node
  (and nothing else);

* a _join_ bag, which has exactly two child bags, and where each child
  bag contains exactly the same nodes as the join bag itself.

As a special case, each leaf bag (which has no child bags at all) is
also considered to be an introduce bag, and will contain exactly one
node.

This routine will also ensure that the root bag is a forget bag,
containing no nodes at all.

This routine will set TreeBag::type() and TreeBag::subtype() for each
bag as follows:

* TreeBag::type() will be one of the constants from the NiceType
  enumeration, indicating whether the bag is an introduce, forget or
  join bag.

* For an introduce bag *b*, TreeBag::subtype() will indicate which
  "new" node was introduced. Specifically, the new node will be
  ``b.element(b.subtype())``.

* For a forget bag *b*, TreeBag::subtype() will indicate which
  "missing" node was forgotten. Specifically, the missing node will be
  ``b.children()->element(b.subtype())``.

* For a join bag, TreeBag::subtype() will be undefined.

If the underlying graph is empty, then this routine will produce a
tree decomposition with no bags at all.

You may optionally pass an argument *heightHint*, which is an array
indicating how close to the root of the tree you would like each node
to be. At present, this only affects the final chain of forget bags
leading up to the root bag - if *heightHint* is passed, then this
chain will be ordered so that nodes with a larger *heightHint* will be
forgotten closer to the root bag. These should be considered hints
only, in that their effect on the final tree decomposition might
change in future versions of Regina.

.. warning::
    Note that TreeBag::subtype() is _not_ the number of the new or
    missing node, but instead gives the _index_ of the new or missing
    node within the relevant bag.

.. note::
    This routine calls compress() automatically, and so there is no
    need to explicitly call compress() before calling makeNice().

Python:
    If a *heightHint* argument is given, it should be passed as a
    Python list of integers.

Parameter ``heightHint``:
    an optional array where, for each node *i*, a higher value of
    ``heightHint[i]`` indicates that the node should be forgotten
    closer to the root bag. If this is non-null, then the size of this
    array should be the number of nodes in the underlying graph.)doc";

PACE text format. This text format is described in detail at
https://pacechallenge.wordpress.com/pace-2016/track-a-treewidth/ , and
is documented in detail by the routine fromPACE(const std::string&).

If you write a tree decomposition using pace() or writePACE() and then
read it again using fromPACE(), you are _not_ guaranteed to obtain an
identical tree decomposition. This is because the PACE text format
stores the connections between bags as an undirected, unrooted tree.

If you are writing this text representation to an output stream then
you should call writePACE() instead, which is more efficient.

Returns:
    the PACE text representation of this tree decomposition.

If the given bag is already the root bag, then this routine does
nothing (and in particular, types and subtypes are preserved).

    This must already be a bag of this tree decomposition.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::TreeDecomposition_::reroot_2
static const char *reroot_2 =
R"doc(Reroots the tree by reversing child-parent relationships, in a way
that minimises a maximum estimated processing cost amongst all bags.

The user needs to supply three arrays, which are used to estimate the
cost of hanging the tree from any possible root. This routine then
identifies which root minimises this cost, and reroots the underlying
tree from that bag.

The three arrays play the following roles. Let *b* be some bag at
index *i* in the original tree decomposition, and let *p* be its
parent bag.

* ``costSame[i]`` indicates the cost of _preserving_ the parent-child
  relationship between *b* and *p* (i.e., after rerooting, *p* is
  still the parent bag of *b*). If *b* is the root bag of the original
  tree decomposition then ``costSame[i]`` is ignored.

* ``costReverse[i]`` indicates the cost of _reversing_ the parent-
  child relationship between *b* and *p* (i.e., after rerooting, *b*
  is now the parent bag of *p*). Again, if *b* is the root bag of the
  original tree decomposition then ``costReverse[i]`` is ignored.

* ``costRoot[i]`` is an additional cost that is incurred if and only
  if *b* becomes the new root bag. The argument *costRoot* may be
  ``None``, in which case these additional costs are all assumed to be
  zero.

It follows that, for each potential new root, there are size() costs
to aggregate: this comes from size()-1 costs from the arrays
*costSame* and/or *costReverse* (one for each connection between bags
in the underlying tree), and one cost from *costRoot*. These costs
will be aggregated by taking the _maximum_ over all individual costs.
This means that you do not need to estimate running times and/or
memory consumption accurately; instead you only need to find some
heuristic that aims to be _monotonic_ in time and/or memory.

So: in essence then, this routine minimises the maximum cost. In the
case of a tie, it then minimises multiplicity; that is, it minimises
the _number_ of times that this maximum cost occurs over the
individual size() costs that are being aggregated.

Note that the *costSame* and *costReverse* arrays are technically
defined as a cost per arc, not a cost per bag. If you wish to estimate
a cost per bag, the typical way of doing this would be:

* ``costSame[i]`` estimates the processing cost at bag *i* if its
  relationship with its parent is preserved;

* ``costReverse[i]`` estimates the processing cost at the original
  _parent_ of bag *i* if its relationship with bag *i* is reversed
  (i.e., it becomes a child of bag *i*);

* ``costRoot[i]`` estimates the processing cost at bag *i* if bag *i*
  becomes the root.

This scheme ensures that, for any possible rerooting, each bag is
costed exactly once amongst the three arrays.

After rerooting, all pointers to bags will remain valid, and the
contents of the bags will not change. However:

* the bags will be reindexed, to reflect the changes in the leaves-to-
  root, left-to-right ordering;

* all bag types will be reset to 0, since in general rerooting may
  break whatever properties the bag types and subtypes represent.

If the given bag is already the root bag, then this routine does
nothing (and in particular, types and subtypes are preserved).

Python:
    The *costSame* and *costReverse* arrays, as well as *costRoot* if
    it is given, should be passed as Python lists of real numbers.
