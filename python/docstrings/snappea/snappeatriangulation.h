Cusp objects essentially package together information about a cusp as
a standalone read-only object. Unlike Triangulation<3>::Vertex and
other skeletal objects, a Cusp object does not uniquely define a cusp
(if you need a unique identifier, use Cusp::vertex() for this). You
can make many copies of the same Cusp object, and each copy will
contain the same information and point to the same vertex of the
underlying triangulation.

Cusp objects should be considered temporary only; you should not hold
onto references or pointers to them. If you need to hold on to
information about a cusp, you can simply copy the Cusp object by value
(an operation that is both cheap and safe).

Cusp objects are small enough to pass by value and swap with
std::swap(), with no need for any specialised move operations or swap
functions.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::SnapPeaTriangulation
static const char *SnapPeaTriangulation =
R"doc(Offers direct access to the SnapPea kernel from within Regina. An
object of this class represents a 3-manifold triangulation, stored
directly in the SnapPea kernel using SnapPea's internal format.

Regarding interaction with the SnapPea kernel:

* This class acts as the **sole C/C++ conduit** between the Regina
  calculation engine and Regina's inbuilt version of the SnapPea
  kernel. Regina should not interact with the SnapPea kernel at the
  C/C++ level other than through this class.

* Regina can, however, interact with SnapPy at the Python level.
  Regina's version of the SnapPea kernel lives within a separate
  namespace (regina::snappea), and so there should be no conflicts
  between Regina's copy and SnapPy's copy of the SnapPea kernel (which
  may even be different versions). You can pass triangulations back
  and forth between Regina and SnapPy using strings that contain the
  contents of a SnapPea data file (see for instance
  SnapPeaTriangulation::snapPea()).

Regarding the inherited Triangulation<3> interface:

* You can happily query this object using both SnapPea functions (such
  as SnapPeaTriangulation::volume(), and others specific to this
  class) and Regina's native triangulation functions (such as
  Triangulation<3>::homology(), and others inherited from
  Triangulation<3>). This is because an object of this class stores
  _two_ representations of the triangulation (SnapPea's and Regina's),
  which are always kept in sync.

* However, you may **only edit this object using the SnapPea functions
  specific to this class** (such as
  SnapPeaTriangulation::randomise()). This is essentially because the
  synchronisation is one-way only (from SnapPea to Regina, but not in
  the other direction).

* Any attempt to edit this triangulation via the inherited
  Triangulation<3> interface (for instance, by calling
  Triangulation<3>::pachner()) will automatically cause this to become
  a **null triangulation**, with no tetrahedra and no SnapPea data at
  all.

* In particular, if you wish to assign one SnapPea triangulation to
  another, or swap the contents of two SnapPea triangulations, then
  you _must_ cast both objects to SnapPeaTriangulation before
  performing the operation. If either argument is presented as the
  parent class Triangulation<3> then the inherited operation on
  Triangulation<3> will be called instead, which will (as above)
  nullify one or both SnapPea triangulations respectively.

* You cannot use simplex and/or facet locks. In particular, you must
  not call Tetrahedron<3>::lock(), Tetrahedron<3>::lockFacet(), or
  Triangle<3>::lock() on a SnapPea triangulation. Any attempt to do so
  is likely to cause exceptions to be thrown in unexpected places.

Null triangulations appear more generally when Regina is unable to
represent data in SnapPea's native format. You can test for a null
triangulation by calling isNull(). Null triangulations can occur for
several reasons, such as (but not limited to):

* attempting to build a SnapPea triangulation from a Regina
  triangulation that is invalid, has boundary faces, or has higher
  genus vertex links (none of which SnapPea can handle);

* attempting to read a broken SnapPea data file;

* attempting to change a SnapPea triangulation using the inherited
  Triangulation<3> interface (as discussed above);

* attempting to import a SnapPea triangulation that uses unsupported
  (e.g., non-integer or non-coprime) filling coefficients, as
  discussed below).

Regarding fillings: SnapPea can store and manipulate Dehn fillings on
cusps, and the SnapPeaTriangulation class respects these where it can
(but with restrictions on the possible filling coefficients; see
below). However, Regina's own Triangulation<3> class knows nothing
about fillings at all. Therefore:

* Routines inherited through the Triangulation<3> interface will
  ignore fillings completely (so, for instance, homology() will return
  the first homology of the unfilled manifold, even if SnapPea has
  designated fillings on the cusps).

* Routines that are defined here in the SnapPeaTriangulation class are
  generally aware of fillings (so, for instance, homologyFilled() will
  return the first homology of the filled manifold). See the
  individual notes for each member function for details on how it
  handles fillings.

* In particular, if you are testing two triangulations for equality:
  if either triangulation is presented as the parent class
  Triangulation<3> then you will be calling the inherited
  Triangulation<3> comparision operators, which _only_ compare the
  tetrahedron labelling and gluings. If you wish to compare cusps and
  fillings as well, you must ensure that both triangulations are cast
  to SnapPeaTriangulation (in which case the SnapPeaTriangulation
  comparison operators will be used).

For now, SnapPeaTriangulation only supports the following types of
filling coefficients: on orientable cusps the filling coefficients
must be coprime integers, and non non-orientable cusps the filling
coefficients must be the integers (Â±1, 0). Any attempt to import a
triangulation from a SnapPea file with filling coefficients outside
these requirements will result in a null triangulation (as discussed
above).

There are many places in the SnapPea kernel where SnapPea throws a
fatal error. These fatal errors are converted into exceptions (in
particular, SnapPeaFatalError and SnapPeaMemoryFull), which can be
caught and handled politely. You should assume, unless you have good
reason to believe otherwise (e.g., you have read and traced through
the SnapPea source code), that any member function of this class that
uses the SnapPea kernel could throw either of these exceptions.

Regina uses the variant of the SnapPea kernel that is shipped with
SnapPy (standard precision), as well as some additional code written
explicitly for SnapPy. The header regina-config.h includes a macro
SNAPPY_VERSION that gives the exact version of SnapPy that is bundled
into Regina, and you can query this at runtime by calling Regina's
function regina::versionSnapPy().

Since Regina 7.0, SnapPeaTriangulation is no longer a "packet type"
that can be inserted directly into the packet tree. Instead a
SnapPeaTriangulation is now a standalone mathematatical object, which
makes it slimmer and faster for ad-hoc use. The consequences of this
are:

* If you create your own SnapPeaTriangulation, it will not have any of
  the usual packet infrastructure. You cannot add it into the packet
  tree, and it will not support a label, tags, child/parent packets,
  and/or event listeners.

* To include a SnapPeaTriangulation in the packet tree, you must
  create a new PacketOf<SnapPeaTriangulation>. This _is_ a packet
  type, and supports labels, tags, child/parent packets, and event
  listeners. It derives from SnapPeaTriangulation, and so inherits the
  full SnapPeaTriangulation interface.

Regarding the packet interface, there is currently a deficiency when
listening for change events on a PacketOf<SnapPeaTriangulation>:

* As described above, if you edit the triangulation using the
  inherited Triangulation<3> interface, this will nullify the SnapPea
  triangulation.

* As expected, this will fire a pair of change events. However, the
  packetToBeChanged() event will be fired too late: specifically, it
  will be fired _after_ the Triangulation<3> change is made but
  _before_ the SnapPea triangulation is nullifed. In particular, it
  will already be too late to take a copy of the original SnapPea
  triangulation.

* Since fixing this will require non-trivial re-engineering of the
  code, and since users should not be modifying SnapPea triangulations
  via the inherited Triangulation<3> interface, this deficiency is
  being left to stay for the time being.

If you add new functions to this class that edit the triangulation,
there are several pieces of bookkeeping to manage: this includes
clearing computed properties, firing packet change events if
necessary, and resyncing the internal Regina triangulation to match
any changes made within the SnapPea kernel. Typically you would manage
these by creating a single SnapPeaChangeSpan on the stack before the
changes takes place. Some notes on this:

* SnapPeaChangeSpan is a private inner class within
  SnapPeaTriangulation (so it is only intended for use within member
  functions).

* SnapPeaChangeSpan _replaces_ the usual ChangeEventSpan (or
  ChangeEventGroup) that would commonly be used with other packet
  types. You should _not_ create a ChangeEventSpan or ChangeEventGroup
  as well.

* The SnapPeaChangeSpan class takes an optional policy template
  argument. Do take care to ensure that you are using the correct
  policy - for example, if you are changing the combinatorics of the
  triangulation then you probably want the default
  ``changeTriangulation``, but if you are only changing the fillings
  on the cusps then ``changeFillingsOnly`` is more appropriate. See
  the inner ChangePolicy enumeration for details.

The SnapPeaTriangulation class implements C++ move semantics and
adheres to the C++ Swappable requirement. It is designed to avoid deep
copies wherever possible, even when passing or returning objects by
value.

static const char *__init_2 =

This copy will be independent (i.e., this triangulation will not be
affected if *tri* is later changed or destroyed).

Since Regina works with more general kinds of trianguations than
SnapPea, not all Regina triangulations can be represented in SnapPea
format. If the conversion is unsuccessful, this will be marked as a
null triangulation. You should always test isNull() to determine
whether the conversion was successful.

Regarding the conversion:

* If *tri* is of the subclass SnapPeaTriangulation, then this
  effectively acts as a copy constructor: all SnapPea-specific
  information will be cloned directly through the SnapPea kernel. If
  *tri* is a null SnapPea triangulation then this copy will be a null
  triangulation also.

* If *tri* is of the parent class Triangulation<3>, then Regina will
  attempt to convert this triangulation to SnapPea format. If the
  conversion is successful, this constructor will immediately ask
  SnapPea to try to find a hyperbolic structure.

Regarding peripheral curves: native Regina triangulations do not store
or use peripheral curves themselves, and so this constructor makes a
default choice during the conversion process. Specifically:

* If solution_type() is geometric_solution or nongeometric_solution,
  then on each torus cusp the meridian and longitude are chosen to be
  the (shortest, second shortest) basis, and their orientations follow
  the convention used by the *SnapPy* kernel. Be warned, however, that
  this choice might not be unique for some cusp shapes, and the
  resolution of such ambiguities might be machine-dependent.

* If solution_type() is something else (e.g., degenerate or flat), or
  if SnapPea throws a fatal error when attempting to install the
  (shortest, second shortest) basis as described above, then Regina
  will accept whatever basis SnapPea installs by default. Be warned
  that this default basis may change (and indeed has changed in the
  past) across different versions of the SnapPea kernel.

Regarding internal vertices (i.e., vertices whose links are spheres):
SnapPea is designed to work only with triangulations where every
vertex is ideal. As a result:

* You may pass a closed triangulation to this constructor, but SnapPea
  will automatically convert this into a filling of a cusped manifold,
  using an ideal triangulation.

* You may also pass a triangulation that uses both ideal and internal
  vertices. In this case, SnapPea will retriangulate the manifold so
  that it uses ideal vertices only.

Even if SnapPea does not retriangulate the manifold (for the reasons
described above), it is possible that the tetrahedron and vertex
numbers might be changed in the new SnapPea triangulation. In
particular, if the given Regina triangulation is orientable but not
oriented, then you should _expect_ these numbers to change.

therefore lose the peripheral curves. Although the

correspond in any way to the original link diagram.

triangulation), these fillings will be completely forgotten.

The canonical cell decomposition is the one described in "Convex hulls
and isometries of cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds", Jeffrey R. Weeks,
Topology Appl. 52 (1993), 127-149.

If the canonical cell decomposition is already a triangulation then we
leave it untouched. Otherwise, the canonical retriangulation
introduces internal (finite) vertices, and is defined as follows:

* within each 3-cell of the original complex we introduce a new
  internal vertex, and cone the 3-cell boundary to this new vertex;

* through each 2-cell of the original complex we insert the dual edge
  (joining the two new finite vertices on either side), and we replace
  the two cones on either side of the 2-cell with a ring of tetrahedra
  surrounding this dual edge.

See canonize_part_2.c in the SnapPea source code for details.

This routine discards the hyperbolic structure along with all SnapPea-
specific information (such as peripheral curves and fillings), and
simply returns one of Regina's native triangulations. If you need to
preserve SnapPea-specific information then you should call
protoCanonise() instead.

SnapPea is not always able to compute the canonical cell
decomposition: if it fails then then this routine will throw an
exception (see below for details).

SnapPy:
    The function ``canonise()`` means different things for SnapPy
    versus the SnapPea kernel. Here Regina follows the naming
    convention used in the SnapPea kernel. Specifically: Regina's
    routine SnapPeaTriangulation::protoCanonise() corresponds to
    SnapPy's ``Manifold.canonize()`` and the SnapPea kernel's
    ``proto_canonize(manifold)``. Regina's routine
    SnapPeaTriangulation::canonise() corresponds to the SnapPea
    kernel's ``canonize(manifold)``, and is not available through

static const char *enumerateCovers =
R"doc(Enumerates connected *k*-sheeted covers of the underlying manifold.
The number of sheets *k* is passed as the first argument to this
function.

Regina does this (with the help of SnapPea) by:

* enumerating all transitive representations of the fundamental group
  into either the symmetric group *S(k)* or the cyclic group *Z_k*
  (according to the parameter *type*), using the SnapPea function
  ``find_representations()``; and then

* building the cover that corresponds to each representation, using
  the SnapPea function ``construct_cover()``.

If you are only interested in the corresponding index *k* subgroups of
the fundamental group and not the triangulated covers themselves, then
you may wish to consider the native Regina function
GroupPresentation::enumerateCovers() instead. That function is highly
optimised, and should be considerably faster as *k* grows.

Each covering space is produced once up to equivalence; here
equivalent covers correspond to conjugate representations of the
fundamental group.

To enumerate _all_ *k*-sheeted covers up to equivalence, set *type* to
*all_covers*. Be warned, however, that this becomes enormously slow as
the number of sheets *k* grows. An alternative is to enumerate only
cyclic covers by setting *type* to *cyclic_covers*; this significantly
limits the set of covers produced but is also much faster for larger
*k*.

For each cover that is produced, this routine will call *action*
(which must be a function or some other callable object).

* The first argument to *action* must be a SnapPea triangulation; this
  will be the newly produced cover. This argument will be passed as an
  rvalue; a typical action could (for example) take it by const
  reference and query it, or take it by value and modify it, or take
  it by rvalue reference and move it into more permanent storage.

* The second argument to *action* must be of type
  *SnapPeaTriangulation::CoverType*. This will indicate the type of
  cover that has been constructed; see the
  SnapPeaTriangulation::CoverType documentation for details. In the
  same call to enumerateCovers() you may observe different types of
  covers being produced (i.e., this value is computed individually for
  each cover). You should, however, never see the value
  *unknown_cover*.

* If there are any additional arguments supplied in the list *args*,
  then these will be passed as subsequent arguments to *action*.

* *action* must return ``void``.

* *action* must not make changes to this original triangulation (i.e.,
  the SnapPeaTriangulation upon which enumerateCovers() is being
  called).

Be aware that this routine does the bulk of its work before any covers
are produced. Specifically, because of the design of the SnapPea
kernel, this routine first enumerates all requested representations of
the fundamental group (which is the slow part), and only then does it
construct the cover and call *action* for each representation, one at
a time.

Precondition:
    This is not a null triangulation.

.. warning::
    If you are enumerating all covers, then the argument *sheets*
    should be _very_ small.

.. warning::
    The covers that are produced will typically use far more
    tetrahedra than necessary. If size is important then you should
    take a copy using Regina's native type Triangulation<3> and call
    intelligentSimplify() on that. Note that you cannot call
    intelligentSimplify() directly on a SnapPeaTriangulation, since
    (like all modifying functions inherited from Triangulation<3>)
    this will nullify the SnapPeaTriangulation. See the class notes
    for further explanation.

.. warning::
    The API for this class or function has not yet been finalised.
    This means that the interface may change in new versions of
    Regina, without maintaining backward compatibility. If you use
    this class directly in your own code, please check the detailed
    changelog with each new release to see if you need to make changes
    to your code.

Python:
    There are two versions of this function available in Python. The
    first form is ``enumerateCovers(sheets, type, action)``, which
    mirrors the C++ function: it takes *action* which may be a pure
    Python function, it returns the number of covers found, but it
    does _not_ take an addition argument list (*args*). The second
    form is ``enumerateCovers(sheets, type)``, which returns a Python
    list containing all of the triangulated covers, each given as a
    pair (SnapPeaTriangulation, SnapPeaTriangulation::CoverType).

Parameter ``sheets``:
    the number of sheets in the covers to produce (i.e., the number
    *k* in the description above); this must be a positive integer.

Parameter ``type``:
    indicates whether to enumerate all covers (up to equivalence) or
    only cyclic covers.

Parameter ``action``:
    a function (or other callable object) to call for each cover that
    is found.

Parameter ``args``:
    any additional arguments that should be passed to *action*,
    following the initial triangulation and type arguments.

Returns:
    the total number of covers found.)doc";

// Docstring regina::python::doc::SnapPeaTriangulation_::fill
static const char *fill =
R"doc(Assigns a Dehn filling to the given cusp. This routine will
automatically ask SnapPea to update the hyperbolic structure according
to the new filling coefficients.

The triangulation itself will not change; this routine will simply ask
SnapPea to store the given filling coefficients alongside the cusp, to
be used in operations such as computing hyperbolic structures. If you
wish to retriangulate to permanently fill the cusp, call filledAll()
or filledPartial() instead.

For orientable cusps only coprime filling coefficients are allowed,
and for non-orientable cusps only (Â±1, 0) fillings are allowed.
Although SnapPea can handle more general fillings, Regina will enforce
these conditions; if they are not satisfied then it will do nothing
and simply return ``False``.

As a special case however, you may pass (0, 0) as the filling
coefficients, in which case this routine will behave identically to
unfill().

It is possible that, if the given integers are extremely large,
SnapPea cannot convert the filling coefficients to its own internal
floating-point representation. If this happens then this routine will
again do nothing and simply return ``False``.

  complete), then it cannot be filled: instead this routine will throw
  an exception.

* If the manifold has only one cusp, then this routine will likewise
  throw an exception. For such scenarios you should call filledAll()

over to the new SnapPea triangulation that is returned.

The canonical cell decomposition is the one described in "Convex hulls
and isometries of cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds", Jeffrey R. Weeks,
Topology Appl. 52 (1993), 127-149.

If the canonical cell decomposition is already a triangulation then we
leave it untouched, and otherwise we triangulate it arbitrarily.
Either way, we preserve the hyperbolic structure.

If you need a canonical triangulation (as opposed to an arbitrary
retriangulation), then you should call canonise() instead.

SnapPea is not always able to triangulate the canonical cell
decomposition: if it fails then then this routine will throw an
exception (see below for details).

SnapPy:
    The function ``canonise()`` means different things for SnapPy
    versus the SnapPea kernel. Here Regina follows the naming
    convention used in the SnapPea kernel. Specifically: Regina's
    routine SnapPeaTriangulation::protoCanonise() corresponds to
    SnapPy's ``Manifold.canonize()`` and the SnapPea kernel's
    ``proto_canonize(manifold)``. Regina's routine
    SnapPeaTriangulation::canonise() corresponds to the SnapPea
    kernel's ``canonize(manifold)``, and is not available through
    SnapPy at all.

.. warning::
    The SnapPea kernel does not always compute the canonical cell
    decomposition correctly. Sometimes it gives the wrong answer,
    although in such a case it still guarantees that the manifold it
    _does_ return is homeomorphic to the original. Sometimes it gives
    no answer at all, in which case this routine will throw an
    exception (see below).

Exception ``SnapPeaIsNull``:
    This is a null SnapPea triangulation.

// Docstring regina::python::doc::SnapPeaTriangulation_::saveSnapPea
static const char *saveSnapPea =
R"doc(Writes this triangulation to the given file using SnapPea's native
file format.

Unlike Triangulation<3>::saveSnapPea(), this routine uses the SnapPea
kernel to produce the file contents. This means it will include not
just the tetrahedron gluings, but also other SnapPea-specific
information that Regina does not use (e.g., peripheral curves).

If this is a null triangulation, then the file will not be written and
this routine will return ``False``.

Internationalisation:
    This routine makes no assumptions about the character encoding
    used in the given file _name_, and simply passes it through
    unchanged to low-level C/C++ file I/O routines. The _contents_ of
    the file will be written using UTF-8.

// Docstring regina::python::doc::SnapPeaTriangulation_::shape
static const char *shape =
R"doc(Returns the shape of the given tetrahedron, with respect to the Dehn

Tetrahedron shapes are given in rectangular form, and using a fixed
coordinate system (fixed alignment, in SnapPea's terminology).

If this is a null triangulation, or if solutionType() is no_solution
or not_attempted (i.e., we did not or could not solve for a hyperbolic
structure), then this routine will simply return zero.

This routine is fast constant time (unlike in SnapPea, where the
corresponding routine *get_tet_shape* takes linear time). Therefore
you can happily call this routine repeatedly without a significant
performance penalty.

SnapPy:
    In SnapPy, this routine corresponds to calling
    ``Manifold.tetrahedra_shapes(part="rect")[tet]``.

Parameter ``tet``:
    the index of a tetrahedron; this must be between 0 and size()-1
    inclusive.

Returns:

// Docstring regina::python::doc::SnapPeaTriangulation_::slopeEquations
static const char *slopeEquations =
R"doc(Returns a matrix for computing boundary slopes of spun-normal surfaces
at the cusps of the triangulation. This matrix includes a pair of rows
for each cusp in the triangulation: one row for determining the
algebraic intersection number with the meridian, followed by one row
for determining the algebraic intersection number with the longitude.

If the triangulation has more than one cusp, these pairs are ordered
by cusp index (as stored by SnapPea). You can examine
``cusp(cusp_number).vertex()`` to map these to Regina's vertex indices
if needed.

For the purposes of this routine, any fillings on the cusps of this
SnapPea triangulation will be ignored.

This matrix is constructed so that, if *M* and *L* are the rows for
the meridian and longitude at some cusp, then for any spun-normal
surface with quadrilateral coordinates *q*, the boundary curves have
algebraic intersection number *M.q* with the meridian and *L.q* with
the longitude. Equivalently, the boundary curves pass *L.q* times
around the meridian and *-M.q* times around the longitude. To compute
these slopes directly from a normal surface, see
NormalSurface::boundaryIntersections().

The orientations of the boundary curves of a spun-normal surface are
chosen so that _if_ meridian and longitude are a positive basis as
vieved from the cusp, then as one travels along an oriented boundary
curve, the spun-normal surface spirals into the cusp to one's right
and down into the manifold to one's left.

SnapPy:
    This has no corresponding routine in SnapPy.

Precondition:
    All vertex links in this triangulation must be tori.

.. warning::
    If this triangulation was constructed from a Regina triangulation
    (of class Triangulation<3>), then Regina will have no information
    about what meridian and longitude the user wishes to use (since
    Regina does not keep track of peripheral curves on cusps).
    Therefore Regina will give boundary slopes relative to the
    (shortest, second-shortest) basis, as described in the constructor
    SnapPeaTriangulation(const Triangulation<3>&, bool). This might
    not be what the user expects.

This routine will behave correctly if *other* is in fact this

.. warning::
    If you wish to swap the contents of two SnapPea triangulations,

    the Triangulation<3> edit routines) both SnapPea triangulations
    will be reset to null triangulations. See the SnapPeaTriangulation
    class notes for further discussion.
