The file mkdoc.py contains a very heavily modified version of pybind11_mkdoc.
The original was taken from:

  https://github.com/pybind/pybind11_mkdoc (commit eec43da56)

The local modifications reorganise the way docstrings are stored and accessed,
strip out a significant amount of unwanted noise (duplicates and/or methods
that Regina does not bind in python), understand a richer variety of Doxygen
markup commands, and better reflect Regina's own custom Doxygen tags.

This tool requires the python clang bindings (on debian/ubuntu, install the
package python3-clang).

This tool is designed to be used by the Regina developers only; it is not
meant to form part of Regina's usual build process.  To regenerate all
docstrings, run ./gendoc.sh.  To regenerate only some of the docstrings,
you can pass ./gendoc.sh an optional list of engine subdirectories.

Most of the headers define *many* static const strings. Therefore:

- Normally, each header should only be included by _one_ of the compiled
  binding sources (*.cpp).

- The exception is those headers that use inline constexpr strings, which
  can happily be included many times. These are whitelisted in the conversion
  tool (see INLINE_FILES near the top of pybind11_mkdoc/mkdoc_lib.py).
  You should *not* whitelist a header that will produce symbols that will
  be used again elsewhere (e.g., the Perm<n> docstrings, all of which define
  different variants of Perm and Perm_ corresponding to different template
  specialisations).
