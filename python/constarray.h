 * A template class that references a constant one-dimensional "array-like"
 * object.  This can be used with plain C-style arrays, or can also be used
 * with constant "array-like" objects such as Perm<4>::S4, which behave like
 * arrays but in fact compute their values on the fly.
 *
 * The requirements for the type Array are:
 *
 * - It must provide a square bracket operator, which returns its results
 *   by value (not by reference or pointer).  This means that we do not
 *   need to specify any return value policy.
 *
 * - An object of type Array is both cheap and safe to copy by value.
 *   For example, this is true for Perm<4>::S4 which is a struct with no
 *   data members.  It is also true for C-style arrays, since what is
 *   actually copied is a pointer, not the array contents.
 *
 * In Python, the usual list operator [] can be used to access the elements
 * of the array.  Range checking is performed on any index that is passed.
 *
 * For each different template parameter, the corresponding
 * ConstArray class must be wrapped in Python before the first object of
 * this class is wrapped.  This wrapping is performed by calling wrapClass().
 *
 * \pre The output operator &lt;&lt; is defined for the objects contained in
 * this array (i.e., for the return type of the square bracket operator).
