/**
 * To access docstrings, python binding code should be structured as:
 *
 * RDOC_SCOPE_BEGIN...
 * ...
 * RDOC_SCOPE_SWITCH...
 * ...
 * RDOC_SCOPE_SWITCH... (etc.)
 * ...
 * RDOC_SCOPE_END
 *
 * Each begin/switch will set the namespace alias rdoc, either to
 * regina::python::doc if you are using ..._MAIN, or to
 * regina::python::doc::s_ if you are using ..._SCOPE(s).
 *
 * You can then access each individual docstring as rdoc::name.
 *
 * If you are within a ..._SCOPE(s) block and s is the name of a
 * class/struct/etc., then rdoc refers to the namespace containing the
 * _members_ of s (which uses a trailing underscore, as noted above),
 * and rdoc_scope is an alias for the docstring for s itself (which has
 * no trailing underscore).
 *
 * If you have an inner class/enum/etc. that is declared within some outer
 * class/struct, then you can use RDOC_SCOPE_INNER_BEGIN(s) or
 * RDOC_SCOPE_INNER_SWITCH(s), with a matching RDOC_SCOPE_INNER_END.
 * This must be placed inside the outer BEGIN ... END block: it will preserve
 * the outer \a rdoc namespace and \a rdoc_scope string declarations, and will
 * declare a new namespace alias \a rdoc_inner and string \a rdoc_inner_scope
 * for working with \a s.  Such inner scopes can (at present) only be nested
 * one level deep.
 *
 * If you are within a ..._SCOPE(c) block for some class c and you also wish to
 * access docstrings for one or more of its base classes b1,b2,..., then you
 * can use RDOC_SCOPE_BASE(b1) (or RDOC_SCOPE_BASE_2(b1, b2), or so on).
 * This will preserve all existing declarations (including \a rdoc), and will
 * also declare new aliases \a rbase and (if relevant) \a rbase2 for the
 * namespaces containing the members of \a b1 and \a b2 respectively.
 * There is no matching END macro; these base class declarations will last
 * until the scope for c is closed.
 *
 * Each BEGIN ... SWITCH or BEGIN ... END block will be contained within
 * curly braces (in particular, local variables will go out of scope at the
 * end of the block).
 *
 * Finally: if you are writing new code and have not yet generated the
 * docstrings, please do not just leave them out - it will be very easy
 * to forget to insert them later.  Instead use the docstring RDOC_TODO,
 * which will expand to a "still to be written" string, and importantly
 * can be searched (and ideally _fixed_) before each formal Regina release.
