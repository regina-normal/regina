# Usage: distcheck <dist-tarball>
#
# Verifies that a tarball formed using "make dist" contains all the
# files it should.  This script outputs a list of files contained in
# the git source tree that are missing from the tarball.
#
# Files that are not necessary for inclusion in the tarball (such as
# auto-generated files or the Regina website) are not included in this
# output.
#
# This script must be run from either the top-level source directory within
# the git source tree, or from the admin/ directory beneath it.
#
# Requires: diff, find, grep, mktemp, sed, sort, tar
