Setting up squeeze chroots under debian lenny
---------------------------------------------

This file documents what I've done on my debian lenny system to set up
i386 and amd64 chroots in which I can build and test packages for regina
under debian 6.0 (otherwise known as squeeze).

These notes are tailored specifically to my own setup, and are not
intended for general use.  See NOTES.txt for further information.


System layout
-------------

- All work is done under debian lenny (the "host system").

- /srv/chroot/sid/chroot is a directory on the host system containing one
  subdirectory for each squeeze chroot (the "guest systems").  This sits
  beneath the sid chroot partition for historical reasons; see 5_sid.txt
  for details on setting up this partition.


Host (debian lenny) configuration
---------------------------------

- Follow the steps described in 0_init-schroot.txt to set up schroot on
  the host debian system.

- Ensure the sid chroot partition is mounted as described in 5_sid.txt.


Guest (debian squeeze) configuration
------------------------------------

- Bootstrap the system:

  (for amd64:)
  lenny# debootstrap squeeze /srv/chroot/sid/chroot/squeeze-amd64
         http://ftp.iinet.net.au/debian/debian/

  (for i386:)
  lenny# debootstrap --arch i386 squeeze /srv/chroot/sid/chroot/squeeze-i386
         http://ftp.iinet.net.au/debian/debian/

- Create guest home directory:

  lenny# mkdir /srv/chroot/sid/chroot/squeeze-amd64/home/bab
  lenny# chown bab.bab /srv/chroot/sid/chroot/squeeze-amd64/home/bab

- Add a schroot entry:

  [squeeze-amd64]
  type=directory
  description=Debian squeeze (amd64)
  location=/srv/chroot/sid/chroot/squeeze-amd64
  priority=3
  users=bab
  root-users=root
  run-setup-scripts=true
  run-exec-scripts=true

  (for amd64 chroots:)
  aliases=squeeze

  (for i386 chroots:)
  personality=linux32

- Install basic graphical system:

  lenny# schroot -c squeeze aptitude install
         less vim zsh kdelibs kdebase kdebase-workspace xnest xserver-xephyr

- Stop host processes that conflict with the guest install:

  lenny# /etc/init.d/fam stop

- Install packages necessary for building regina:

  lenny# schroot -c squeeze aptitude install
         build-essential devscripts fakeroot lintian automake1.9 debhelper
         doxygen kdelibs4-dev libboost-python-dev libcppunit-dev libgmp3-dev
         libmpich1.0-dev libpopt-dev libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev
  lenny# schroot -c squeeze aptitude clean

- Install other packages useful for running and testing regina:

  lenny# schroot -c squeeze aptitude install gap graphviz kpdf kig mpich-bin
  lenny# schroot -c squeeze aptitude clean

- Follow the final steps described in 9_final-guestuser.txt to start a
  chrooted session.
