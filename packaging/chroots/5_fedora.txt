Setting up fedora chroots under debian lenny (amd64)
----------------------------------------------------

This file documents what I've done on my debian lenny system to set up
i386 and x86_64 chroots in which I can build and test fedora packages
for regina.

These notes are tailored specifically to my own setup, and are not
intended for general use.  See NOTES.txt for further information.

TODO: A note should be added on disabling ccache on the guest system.


System layout
-------------

- Unless otherwise specified, all work is done under debian lenny
  (the "host debian system").

- A standalone fedora installation (the "host fedora system") is
  installed on its own separate partition (currently 4G and 75% full).
  This is mounted within the host debian system in /srv/chroot/fchost.

  The host fedora system is used purely for calling mock to bootstrap
  the various fedora chroots.  At the time of writing it runs fedora 10
  (x86_64) but this may be upgraded from time to time.

- /srv/chroot/fedora is a directory on the host debian system containing
  one subdirectory for each final fedora chroot (the "guest fedora systems").
  This area is mounted from a separate partition (currently 20G, and only
  about 60% full).  Each subdirectory is managed by mock, and the chroot
  filesystems live within root/ inside each of these subdirectories.


Host debian system configuration (debian lenny)
-----------------------------------------------

- Follow the steps described in 0_init-schroot.txt to set up schroot on
  the host debian system.

- Mount the guest fedora partition as /srv/chroot/fedora, and mount
  the host fedora partition as /srv/chroot/fchost:

  (from /etc/fstab:)
  LABEL=/fedora /srv/chroot/fedora ext3 defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 0
  LABEL=/ /srv/chroot/fchost ext3 defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 0

- Create a new fstab file /etc/schroot/mount-fedora, which consists of
  the standard /etc/schroot/mount-defaults plus the following extra line:

  /srv/chroot/fedora /var/lib/mock none rw,bind 0 0

- Create a new schroot script /etc/schroot/script-fedora, which is a
  copy of /etc/schroot/script-rpm but which uses the new fstab file:

  (/etc/schroot/script-fedora, line 5:)
  - FSTAB="/etc/schroot/mount-defaults"
  + FSTAB="/etc/schroot/mount-fedora"

- Add a schroot entry for the fedora host, which will only be used as root:

  [fchost]
  type=directory
  description=Fedora chroot host
  location=/srv/chroot/fchost
  priority=3
  root-users=root
  run-setup-scripts=true
  run-exec-scripts=true
  script-config=script-fedora


Host fedora system configuration
--------------------------------

- After installing the host fedora system, run the SELinux Administration
  tool and make SELinux disabled by default.  Otherwise schroot can mess
  with the SELinux file labellings and render the host system unbootable.

- Chroot into the host fedora system and ensure that mock is installed:

  debian# schroot -c fchost yum install mock


Guest fedora system configuration
-----------------------------------

- Enter the fedora host in order to bootstrap the guest system:

  debian# schroot -c fchost

- Locate the relevant config file in /etc/mock/:

  fchost# ls /etc/mock
  ...
  fedora-7-i386.cfg
  fedora-7-x86_64.cfg
  ...

- Comment out the updates repository from this config file:

  (from /etc/mock/fedora-7-x86_64.cfg:)
  # [updates-released]
  # name=updates
  # mirrorlist=...

- Set up a base graphical system:

  fchost# mock -r fedora-7-x86_64 --init
  fchost# mock -r fedora-7-x86_64 --install yum man kdelibs kdebase (on <= fc8)
  fchost# mock -r fedora-7-x86_64 --install yum man kdelibs kdebase
                                            kdebase-workspace       (on >= fc9)

- Edit the guest yum configuration to (i) disable updates, and (ii) output
  useful information during download and installation:

  (from /var/lib/mock/fedora-7-x86_64/root/etc/yum.conf:)
  ...
  debuglevel=2
  ...
  # [updates-released]
  # name=updates
  # mirrorlist=
  ...

  (from /var/lib/mock/fedora-7-x86_64/root/etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-updates.repo:)
  enabled=0

- Verify that only the main repository is enabled:

  fchost# grep enabled=1 /var/lib/mock/fedora-7-x86_64/root/etc/yum.repos.d/*
  /var/lib/mock/fedora-7-x86_64/root/etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo:enabled=1

- Add a schroot entry in the debian host system:

  [fc7-x86_64]
  type=directory
  description=Fedora 7 (x86_64)
  location=/srv/chroot/fedora/fedora-7-x86_64/root
  priority=3
  users=bab
  root-users=root
  run-setup-scripts=true
  run-exec-scripts=true
  script-config=script-rpm

  (for x86_64 chroots:)
  aliases=fc7

  (for i386 chroots:)
  personality=linux32

- Enter the guest fedora system to continue the installation:

  debian# schroot -c fc7-x86_64

- Rebuild the RPM database in the format expected by the guest system
  (rather than the fedora host system):

  fcguest# rm /var/lib/rpm/__db.*
  fcguest# rpm --rebuilddb

- Double-check again that no updates are enabled:

  fcguest# yum repolist

- Install useful utilities, embedded X servers and some basic fonts:

  fcguest# yum install patchutils rootfiles vim-enhanced wget zsh
                       xdg-utils kde-settings
  fcguest# yum install xorg-x11-server-{Xorg,Xnest,Xephyr} vnc-server
                       xorg-x11-fonts-{truetype,100dpi,misc,Type1}

- Install packages for building and running regina:

  fcguest# yum install rpmlint boost-devel cppunit-devel doxygen gmp-devel
                       libselinux-devel libxml2-devel python-devel zlib-devel

  fcguest# yum install popt              (on <= fc7)
  fcguest# yum install popt-devel        (on >= fc8)

  fcguest# yum install kdelibs-devel qt-devel            (on <= fc8)
  fcguest# yum install kdelibs3-devel qt3-devel kdebase3 (on >= fc9)

  fcguest# yum install kdegraphics graphviz
  fcguest# yum install kdeedu (on <= fc9)
  fcguest# yum install kdeedu-math (on >= fc10)

- Symlink /bin/zsh to /usr/bin/zsh:

  fcguest# ln -s /bin/zsh /usr/bin/zsh

- Manually add an ordinary user:

  fcguest# groupadd -g 1000 bab
  fcguest# useradd -u 1000 -g 1000 bab

- Follow the final steps described in 9_final-guestuser.txt to start a
  chrooted session.
