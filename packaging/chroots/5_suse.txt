Setting up suse chroots under debian etch (amd64)
-------------------------------------------------

This file documents what I've done on my debian etch system to set up
i586 and x86_64 chroots in which I can build and test suse packages
for regina.

These notes are tailored specifically to my own setup, and are not
intended for general use.  See NOTES.txt for further information.


System layout
-------------

- Unless otherwise specified, all work is done under debian etch
  (the "host debian system").

- In constrast to every other distribution described here (debian,
  fedora, mandriva and ubuntu), each final suse chroot lives in its own
  separate partition that can be booted as a standalone GNU/Linux
  system.  These partitions (the "guest suse systems") are mounted as
  subdirectories of /srv/chroot/suse on the debian host.  Each partition
  is 5G in size with at least 1.5G free.

  The reason for using separate partitions is that I cannot find a nice
  way of doing for suse what debootstrap, urpmi and mock do for other
  distributions, i.e., bootstrapping a new suse installation inside a
  subdirectory of some larger suse system (which may be a different version
  and/or architecture).  If anybody knows how to do this, I'm all ears.


Host debian system configuration (debian etch)
----------------------------------------------

- Follow the steps described in 0_init-schroot.txt to set up schroot on
  the host debian system.


Guest suse system configuration
-------------------------------

- Reboot and install the guest SuSE system into its own partition using
  the standard install DVDs/CDs.

  + During software selection, ensure that both openoffice and the java
    runtime are marked as taboo (this is to save on space).

  + Be sure to skip the online update step during the installation.
    Moreover, when the new SuSE system is first booted, reconfigure
    the online update applet to *not* start automatically.

- Fire up YaST to install the necessary software, which includes:

  + Packages needed for building regina:

    boost-devel doxygen gcc-c++ gmp-devel kdelibs3-devel libcppunit-devel
    libjpeg-devel libstdc++-devel libxml2-devel popt-devel python-devel
    qt3-devel zlib-devel

  + Packages needed for running regina, and for supporting the chroot:

    graphviz kdebase3 kdeedu3 susehelp zsh xorg-x11-server-extra

  + On SuSE 10.2 (and presumably earlier), there is no need for a separate
    xorg-x11-server-extra package, and the libcppunit packages are just
    called cppunit/cppunit-devel.

  + Some packages are not shipped with the standard DVDs/CDs (notably
    cppunit and sometimes kdeedu3).  These can be downloaded locally from
    ftp://mirror.pacific.net.au/linux/opensuse/distribution/.

- Remove unnecessary software until the partition has >= 1.5G free.
  Multimedia apps and large documentation packages are good targets.

- Reboot into the host debian system.

- Give the new suse filesystem a unique label (to be used in /etc/fstab):

  debian# tune2fs -L /suse10.3-x86_64 /dev/sda8

- Mount the guest suse partition as a subdirectory of /srv/chroot/suse:

  (from /etc/fstab:)
  LABEL=/suse10.3-x86_64 /srv/chroot/suse/10.3-x86_64 ext3
      defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 0

- Add a schroot entry in the debian host system:

  [suse10.3-x86_64]
  type=directory
  description=SuSE 10.3 (x86_64)
  location=/srv/chroot/suse/10.3-x86_64
  priority=3
  users=bab
  root-users=root
  run-setup-scripts=true
  run-exec-scripts=true

  (for x86_64 chroots:)
  aliases=suse10.3

  (for i586 chroots:)
  personality=linux32

- Follow the final steps described in 9_final-guestuser.txt to start a
  chrooted session.
