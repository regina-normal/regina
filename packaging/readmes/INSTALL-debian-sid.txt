Regina for Debian:  Sid (Unstable)
----------------------------------

If you run Sid (the Debian unstable release), you can install Regina from
the usual Debian servers like any other package:

  example$ aptitude install regina-normal

Sid always ships with the latest version of Regina (though it may take a
day or two for new versions to appear on your Debian mirror).

If you are a C++ programmer and you wish to build Regina into your own
projects, you will also want the package "regina-normal-dev".

If you want the MPI-enabled utilities for use on high-performance clusters,
you will want the package "regina-normal-mpi".
