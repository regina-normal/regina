  * New upstream release.
  * Builds under gcc 4.3 (closes: #455296).

regina-normal (4.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Nov 2007 10:28:59 +1100

regina-normal (4.3.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split the MPI utilities into a separate package regina-normal-mpi.  This
    means that desktop users don't need to install mpich.
  * Re-enabled MPI utilities on the ia64 architecture (these were disabled in
    early 2006 due to linker failures).

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Nov 2007 06:26:03 +1100

regina-normal (4.3.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated for new debian menu layout.  Menu entries have moved from
    Apps/Math to Applications/Science/Mathematics.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Oct 2007 07:46:20 +1000

regina-normal (4.3.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another step in the python dance.  Everything is back to python2.4,
    since boost.python has switched back from python2.5 to python2.4 as of
    boost 1.34.1-2 (closes: #439464).  Updated libboost-python-dev
    build-depends version accordingly.
  * And another step in the boost dance.  The libboost_*.so symlinks under
    debian have recently changed from multi-threaded to single-threaded
    versions of the relevant libraries.  Changed the configure script to
    try the -mt suffix *before* the default library, not after.
  * Added an automated check during the package build that makes sure the
    multi-threaded boost.python is used (debian/mtcheck).
  * Passes an explicit python version to ./configure, so that things stay
    sane even when multiple python*-dev packages are installed on the build
    machine.
  * Lintian fixes: (i) change -$(MAKE) distclean so the clean can only fail
    if the Makefile is missing; (ii) change ${Source-Version} to
    ${binary:Version} in the regina-normal-dev dependencies.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Aug 2007 19:09:29 +1000

regina-normal (4.3.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update autoconf boost check to account for the recent transition
    from libboost_python.so to libboost_python-mt.so (closes: #425926).
  * Update all dependencies to require python2.5, since this is now what
    boost uses.  Build-depends on libboost-python-dev >= 1.34.0 accordingly.
  * Incorporate patch from upstream SVN that removes virtual templates,
    thus allowing regina-normal to build under gcc-4.2 (closes: #370183).
  * The patch above removes the NVertexEnumerator class completely, and
    makes all enumeration routines in NDoubleDescriptor static.  For this
    reason, the libraries in /usr/lib/ have changed their release version
    from 4.3.1 to 4.3.1a.  Any third-party code that links against these
    libraries will need to be rebuilt.
  * Switch from DH_COMPAT to debian/compat.
  * Bump standards-version to 3.7.2.2 (no changes required).

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Sat, 26 May 2007 09:20:55 +1000

regina-normal (4.3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed www-browser as an alternative to konqueror in regina-normal-doc
    recommendations, since the GUI needs konqueror specifically to open the
    API docs from the help menu.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Oct 2006 22:25:06 +1100

regina-normal (4.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patched trisetcmp to give appropriate messages for subcomplex testing
    (instead of using the same messages as for isomorphism testing).
  * Added XS-Python-Version and XB-Python-Version fields to debian/control
    as requested by new python policy (closes: #380931).
  * Switched to debhelper compatibility level 5.
  * Bumped standards-version to 3.7.2.1 (no changes required).

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Oct 2006 11:35:15 +1000

regina-normal (4.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Moved khelpcenter from suggests to recommends, since it's really not
    good if the help menu isn't working.
  * Now suggests graphviz, which is used for drawing face pairing graphs.
  * Added a regina.xpm icon in /usr/share/pixmaps for GNOME users who can't
    see the KDE icons.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Fri,  5 May 2006 08:19:09 +1000

regina-normal (4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * C++ syntax now adheres to the requirements of gcc 4.1 (closes: #358062).

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Mar 2006 08:48:41 +1100

regina-normal (4.2.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depends on kdelibs4-dev (>= 4:3.5.1-3), so that the cached HTML
    reference manual has the correct legal notice (GPL).  The meinproc from
    older versions of kdelibs incorrectly claimed that all documentation was
    under the GFDL instead.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Mar 2006 07:22:55 +1100

regina-normal (4.2.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Temporarily ship ia64 packages without MPI utilities, since the MPI code
    fails to link under ia64.  These utilities will be restored once the link
    failure can be tracked down.
  * All architectures other than ia64 are unaffected by this change.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Feb 2006 07:53:24 +1100

regina-normal (4.2.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the NSnapPeaTriangulation tests more robust to avoid crashes
    caused by taking log10(0) when the answers are very, very accurate.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Jan 2006 11:00:41 +1100

regina-normal (4.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to debian's patched libtool 1.5.22.  This should support
    Debian GNU/k*BSD, and should also streamline package dependencies
    (closes: #343965).
  * Build-depends on automake1.9 since we now need to rerun autoconf,
    automake and friends.
  * Applied the debian/KDE disable_no_undefine patch to admin/kde.m4.ext,
    which is needed because of the libtool update.
  * Made the NSnapPeaTriangulation tests more flexible for degenerate
    triangulations, to allow for different floating point behaviour under
    different chipsets (closes: #326790).
  * Bumped standards-version to 3.6.2.2 (no changes required).

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Jan 2006 08:10:22 +1100

  * Uploaded for the g++-4 / KDE 3.4 transition.  Build-depends and shlibs
    files adjusted accordingly.
  * Fixed incorrect include directory in "regina-engine-config --cflags".
  * Fixed incorrect path to API docs in doc-base file.
  * Updated FSF address in the copyright file.
  * Bumped standards-version to 3.6.2.1 (no changes required).

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Aug 2005 01:06:11 +1000

regina-normal (4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor tidying up in the debian directory.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Jul 2005 18:35:25 +1000

regina-normal (4.1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt against boost 1.32.0 since 1.31 is no longer in the archives.
  * Minor aesthetic changes to package descriptions.

regina-normal (4.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Updated to use python2.3 to stay consistent with boost.python (and
    versioned the libboost-python-dev dependency at >= 1.31.0-5 accordingly).
  * Suggests gap, which can now be used to help simplify fundamental groups.
  * Recommends (konqueror | www-browser) for regina-normal-doc instead of
    just www-browser.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Jun 2004 01:07:41 +1000
