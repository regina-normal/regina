Regina - A Normal Surface Theory Calculator

    This file describes key highlights of the changes between releases.

    For a full list of changes, including all changes to the C++/Python API,
    see the file CHANGES.txt.

Version 5.1  [ 19 December, 2016 ]

    Features:
        - This release is a major overhaul for Python and C++ users.  There
          are also enhancements to the mathematics and the user interface,
          but these are relatively minor (and are not listed here).
    Python and C++:
        - All of the code that was deprecated in version 5.0 has now been
          removed entirely.  See http://regina-normal.github.io/regina4to5.html
          for instructions on how to update your scripts.
        - Many class and header names have changed, but most of these changes
          follow a standard pattern (classes of the form NFoo become Foo, and
          headers of the form nfoo.h become foo.h).  The old class and header
          names have been kept, and will not be removed until Regina 6.0.
          See http://regina-normal.github.io/regina5to6.html for details.
        - More of Regina's triangulation code is now generic, which means
          you can do more with higher-dimensional triangulations (e.g.,
          triangulate boundary components, or compute homology).
        - The old "python libraries" facility has been removed, since Python
          itself offers better and more standardised ways of importing code.

Version 5.0  [ 26 September, 2016 ]

    Features:
        - Regina now works with 4-manifolds!  It also offers a more basic
          framework for triangulations in higher dimensions (up to 15).
        - You can now enumerate, study and triangulate normal hypersurfaces in
          4-manifold triangulations.
        - Regina now builds and manipulates tree decompositions of graphs,
          including dual graphs of triangulations.  This is particularly
          useful for fixed-parameter tractable algorithms.
        - Turaev-Viro invariants are now computed using exact arithmetic.
        - When fast-and-greedy simplification fails, you can now try
          "exhaustive simplification", which searches through the Pachner graph.
    Python and C++:
        - The API (functions, classes, etc.) has had an enormous overhaul.
          Many things are now simpler, shorter, and more consistent.
          Most of the old classes and functions have been kept for backward
          compatibility, but WILL BE REMOVED in the next release.
        - Regina is now based on the newer C++11 standard.
        - Python now interacts with Regina more naturally, and error messages
          are likely to be both fewer and more helpful.  Thanks to
          Matthias Goerner for his help with this.
        - Regina no longer clobbers Python's own builtin open() function!
          For Regina's verison of open(), you can still call regina.open().
    Optimisations:
        - Many widespread structural changes under the hood.
        - Several new optimisations, most notably including treewidth-based
          algorithms for Turaev-Viro invariants (arXiv:1503.04099).

Version 4.96  [ 29 August, 2014 ]

    Features:
        - Regina can now certify hyperbolicity rigorously and quickly, using
          angle structures and linear programming.  See the Recognition tab
          in the triangulation viewer.
        - SnapPea triangulations are now a separate type of packet.  They
          use both Regina's and SnapPea's internal data structures, so all of
          SnapPea's internal information (e.g., fillings and peripheral curves)
          will be preserved when you import from SnapPea/SnapPy.  SnapPea's
          filling routines are also made available directly through Regina.
        - Census lookup is now automatic (see the Recognition tab), extremely
          fast, and draws on a much larger database of 296,862 triangulations.
        - You can now puncture manifolds, build connected sums, make 1-4 moves,
          and decompose non-orientable manifolds into prime pieces.
        - The API has many more conveniences for Python and C++ users, plus
          some structural changes under the hood in preparation for the
          coming 4-manifolds release.
    Other optimisations:
        - Simplification and recognition of fundamental groups is now much
          stronger, thanks to Nielsen moves and new recognition heuristics.
        - Enumeration of taut angle structures is now much faster, thanks to
          new tree traversal / linear programming machinery.
        - The commit / refresh buttons are gone from the user interface
          (all changes now take effect immediately).

Version 4.95  [ 12 November, 2013 ]

    Features:
        - Hakenness and irreducibility tests for triangulations.
        - On many GNU/Linux and MacOS systems, Regina and SnapPy can now talk
          directly via python.  Try running 'import snappy' from one of
          Regina's python environments, or see the python chapter in the
          user handbook for examples.
        - Many example triangulations are now oriented by default.
        - You are no longer required to give each packet a unique label.
    Optimisations:
        - More widespread use of the new and faster branch-and-bound machinery.
        - Large-scale cleanups and improvements to the API for both C++
          and python, plus additional niceities for the python bindings.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed two numerical bugs in the arbitrary precision arithmetic code
          that were (i) only present in the last release (4.94, September 2013);
          (ii) quite difficult to trigger; and (iii) had relatively benign
          impacts, unless you were working with experimental code direct from
          the repository.  We have audited the entire codebase to analyse what
          could have been affected, so please contact the authors if you need
          more information.

Version 4.94  [ 24 September, 2013 ]

    Features:
        - Regina now works with 2-manifold triangulations as well.
          You can (for example) use these to study vertex links.
        - You can now drill out the neighbourhood of an edge.
    Optimisations:
        - Normal surface enumeration is now completely different under the
          hood, and uses new linear programming techniques (arXiv:1010.6200,
          arXiv:1211.1079).  This may be slower for small problems, but is
          significantly faster for larger problems.
        - In particular, 0-efficiency testing, solid torus recognition,
          connected sum decomposition and 3-sphere recognition are now
          *much* faster.  Try it: Regina can prove the Weber-Seifert
          dodecahedral space to be 0-efficient in around 10 seconds.
        - Simplification of fundamental groups is much more powerful,
          thanks to small cancellation theory.
        - Census enumeration is faster again, with new pruning techniques.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed 0-efficiency testing, which was reporting incorrect
          results for ideal triangulations.  The automated test suite is
          now greatly enhanced to avoid a similar problem appearing again.
    Backward Compatibility:
        - Old-style binary files are no longer supported.  These have
          not been in use for over a decade now.
        - For programmers: some old deprecated routines have now been removed.
          If there is something you are missing, check the deprecation page
          (regina.sourceforge.net/deprecation.html) to see what replaces it.

Version 4.93  [ 30 May, 2012 ]

    Features:
        - Implements solid torus recognition, and by corollary unknot
          recognition.  The necessary tools were already there, but this
          rolls them into a single "one-click" procedure.
        - Identifies which taut angles structures are veering structures.
        - Adds the Weeks manifold to the list of example triangulations
          that you can construct.
        - Exports triangulations in a text format that can be passed to
          Matveev's 3-manifold recogniser software.
    User Interface:
        - Restored File -> Save and Save As to the menu.  These were missing
          in version 4.92.
        - The old Surfaces tab in the triangulation viewer is now the
          Recognition tab, and combines exact high-level algorithms
          with "opportunistic" combinatorial recognition.
    Python:
        - Python consoles now set the variable "item" to the currently selected
          packet in the tree, not "selected".  This is easier to type, and
          avoids the misconception that changing the selection afterwards will
          change the variable (it doesn't).  If nothing is selected, Regina
          will now explicitly set item=None.
        - All use of NTriBool is gone from the classes NTriangulation and
          NNormalSurface.  Tests such as NNormalSurface::isOrientable() and
          NTriangulation::hasCompressingDisc() now return an ordinary boolean
          that you can test in the natural way in Python.

Version 4.92  [ 12 April, 2012 ] - The "hello Windows!" release.

    Installation
        - MacOS users now have a simple drag-and-drop install.
          If you want, you can now get rid of fink.
        - Windows users can install Regina!  This is also a simple
          point-and-click install.
        - Linux users have far fewer dependencies than before: Regina is
          now based on Qt only, and does not use anything from KDE.
    User Interface:
        - The user interface has continued its overhaul, with many more
          usability improvements.
        - Regina now uses many small windows instead of one monolithic window.
          You can return to the "old way" via Regina's settings if you prefer.
    Features:
        - You can now enumerate all fundamental normal surfaces, as well as
          all vertex normal surfaces.  See arXiv:1111.7055 for the algorithms.
        - Face pairing graphs now have labels for tetrahedron numbers.
        - You can now see boundary slopes for spun normal surfaces;
          thanks to William Pettersson and Stephan Tillmann.
        - There is now experimental support for transversely oriented
          normal surfaces.  Again, thanks to Will and Stephan.
    Python:
        - All python sessions now execute "from regina import *" by default.
          For regina-python, you can disable this by passing --noautoimport.

Version 4.91: Internal development version.

Version 4.90  [ 12 September, 2011 ] - First prerelease for version 5.0.

    Installation:
        - Regina has been ported to KDE4, which means you can finally
          install it on a modern GNU/Linux distribution.
        - The experience on MacOSX is much cleaner and more natural
          than it ever was before.  You no longer need X11; instead
          Regina acts almost like a native Mac app (though you still
          need Fink; we're a long way yet from a drag-and-drop install).
    User Interface:
        - The user interface has had a complete overhaul, and there have
          been many small-but-important improvements to usability.
        - The Regina Handbook has also had a complete overhaul.  It is
          more readable and streamlined, and full of screenshots to walk
          you through what Regina can do.
    Features:
        - Regina now supports isomorphism signatures, which are short
          sequences of letters, digits and punctuation that identify a
          triangulation uniquely up to combinatorial isomorphism.
        - You can enumerate all taut angle structures, which is much
          faster than enumerating all vertex angle structures.
        - You can test normal surfaces for incompressibility (through
          C++/Python only).  See arXiv:0909.4625 for the algorithms.
        - In an orientable triangulation, you can now relabel vertices to make
          all gluing maps orientation-reversing.  Just press the big Orient
          button in the triangulation viewer.  Thanks to Matthias Goerner.
    Optimisations:
        - A lot has changed under the hood for this release: the code is
          generally cleaner and more streamlined throughout.
        - Normal surface enumeration is significantly faster again,
          due to the use of a new trie-like data structure.
    C++ / Python Changes:
        - Yet more code is deprecated in preparation for Regina 5.0.
          See http://regina.sourceforge.net/deprecation.html
          for a guide to updating your scripts and programs.
        - You no longer need to call NTriangulation::gluingsHaveChanged().
        - When building triangulations, you should now add tetrahedra using
          NTriangulation::newTetrahedron(), not create tetrahedra yourself.

Version 4.6  [ 16 May, 2009 ]

    Features:
        - Some important changes regarding almost normal surfaces:
            + Regina no longer strips out surfaces with more than one octagon
              (though it still enforces at most one octagon *type*).  This is
              important if you plan to use the vertex surfaces as a basis.
            + You can now enumerate vertex almost normal surfaces in
              quadrilateral-octagon coordinates (arXiv:0904.3041).
            + The normal surface viewer now tells you where the octagon is,
              so you don't have to scroll through 10n coordinates to find it.
        - The normal surface viewer now has two new tabs:
            + The Summary tab gives a quick overview of what kinds of
              surfaces were found, to save scrolling through the entire list.
            + The Compatibility tab gives a visual overview of which pairs of
              surfaces are locally compatible (no conflicting quadrilaterals
              or octagons), and globally compatible (can be made disjoint).
        - You can now cut along a normal surface (which retriangulates the
          resulting pieces).  Unlike crushing, no topology is lost.
        - Simplification is now much more effective for triangulations with
          boundary and/or multiple vertices.
        - Added 3-ball recognition to the Surfaces tab for triangulations.
        - Elementary moves now include "close book" and "collapse edge".
        - You can now copy dehydration strings (and any other information
          in the triangulation composition tab) by right-clicking.
        - Normal surfaces are now automatically numbered in the viewer,
          to help keep track of which is which.
    Optimisations:
        - Enumeration of normal (or almost normal) surfaces in standard
          coordinates is now orders of magnitude faster again, thanks to the
          quadrilateral-to-standard conversion algorithm (arXiv:0901.2629).
        - Likewise, 3-sphere recognition is now orders of magnitude faster.
        - Ported several recent census optimisations to the more
          general setting of enumerating non-minimal triangulations.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed simplification bugs for bounded and invalid triangulations:
            + Fixed some crashes involving bounded triangulations.
            + Fixed some nasty bugs in the boundary shelling move, which in
              some cases could simplify bounded triangulations incorrectly.
            + Fixed bugs whereby invalid triangulations could have the
              offending points truncated or pushed into cusps.
    C++ / Python Changes:
        - A fair amount of code is now deprecated in preparation for
          Regina 5.0.  See http://regina.sourceforge.net/deprecation.html
          for a guide to updating your scripts and programs accordingly.

Version 4.5.1  [ 28 October, 2008 ]

    Features:
        - PDF documents can now be embedded within data files as PDF packets.
          This allows you to document your data in detail with equations
          and diagrams.  See File -> Open Example -> Introductory Examples
          for an illustration.
    Optimisations:
        - Normal surface enumeration is now orders of magnitude faster,
          and consumes significantly less memory.  See arXiv:0808.4050
          for a full list of improvements.
    Census Improvements:
        - Replaced the old plain-text Notation packets in the closed
          orientable / non-orientable censuses with detailed PDF packets.
          These new PDFs explain the precise meanings and conventions used
          in all the manifold names, and include supporting diagrams.
        - Renamed a few census manifolds to replace the old (a)/(b) suffixes
          with something more meaningful.  See CHANGES.txt for details.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed a bug in the routine NGraphTriple::writeTeXName().  This does
          not affect any census data that has been published or shipped with
          earlier versions of Regina, but it might affect users who have
          called writeTeXName() in their own Python scripts.  Please send an
          email if you would like further information.

Version 4.5  [ 17 May, 2008 ]

    Features and Improvements:
        - Full support for international characters (finally!):
            + Users should be able to use international characters in data
              files without problems, and they should display, save and load
              correctly.  Regina's own data files are stored using UTF-8,
              and users can choose an encoding where relevant for imports
              and exports.
            + Programmers who plan to use international characters with the
              python interface or in their own C++ code should read the new
              page "Encodings for international strings", listed under
              "Related Pages" in Regina's python reference.
        - Normal surface lists can now be exported as plain-text CSV files
          (comma-separated values), which can then be imported into
          spreadsheets or databases.
        - Added the Seifert-Weber dodecahedral space as one of the ready-made
          examples offered when creating a new triangulation.
        - Added the new python library loadCensus.py, which gives easy access
          to the prepackaged census data files.  To make use of this library,
          add it through Regina's python settings.
    Optimisations:
        - Regina is now somewhat less memory-hungry; in particular, memory
          usage for triangulations has been cut by about 1/3.  This should
          help when opening very large data files, such as census data.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed some crashes that occured when packets were deleted from the
          tree while they were still being used elsewhere.
    Build Infrastructure:
        - Supports building out-of-tree (e.g., making separate builds in
          debug/ and release/ subdirectories).

Version 4.4  [ 25 November, 2007 ] - The "hug a Mac today" release.

    Features and Improvements:
        - New Algebra -> Cellular Info tab containing a variety of new
          homological data for triangulations; thanks to Ryan Budney for this!
        - Expanded both the closed orientable and non-orientable censuses
          to 11 tetrahedra (the 11-tetrahedron section of the orientable
          census is very large and must be downloaded separately).
        - Can construct any Seifert fibred space over the 2-sphere (previously
          at most three exceptional fibres could be supplied).
        - Shows Callahan-Hildebrand-Weeks dehydration strings in the
          triangulation composition tab.
        - Matrices are significantly easier to work with in Python scripts,
          with several new functions and operators now available.
        - More consistent choice of monodromy matrices when identifying
          torus bundles.
        - The regina-python tool can now run scripts in interactive mode (-i).
        - Builds and runs on MacOS!  This requires Fink to be installed.
    Optimisations:
        - Census generation made significantly faster yet again, using
          tests for high-genus vertex links and other optimisations.
        - Streamlined some core parts of the triangulation code for
          faster processing.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Face pairing graphs now look better when the old Graphviz 1.x is
          installed (previously they were designed for Graphviz 2.x only).
        - Fixed a matrix reduction bug when dealing with non-orientable
          torus bundles (sometimes the transpose matrix was given instead).
        - Updated the trisetcmp program to output more appropriate messages
          when testing for subcomplexes.

Version 4.3.1  [ 5 May, 2006 ]

    Features and Improvements:
        - Now imports Orb / Casson triangulations; thanks to Ryan Budney
          for contributing this import filter.
        - Displays the face pairing graphs of triangulations (see the
          Skeleton tab in the triangulation viewer).  Graphviz is used
          to render the graphs.
    Optimisations:
        - Census generation made faster again, this time using the new
          face pairing graph results of math.GT/0604584.
    Bug Fixes:
        - No longer crashes when the user tries to clone the root of
          the packet tree.
        - Added a workaround for the buggy icon themes supplied by some
          GNU/Linux distributions; there should no longer be unknown
          icons appearing in the packet tree.
        - Fixed memory leak in the census generation code.

Version 4.3  [ 27 March, 2006 ]

    Features and Improvements:
        - Expanded both the closed orientable and closed non-orientable
          censuses to ten tetrahedra.  The closed orientable census is
          now split into two files (large and small).
        - Recognises a much greater variety of Seifert fibred spaces and
          graph manifolds by examining their combinatorial structures (to
          the point where 1359 / 1390 of the closed non-orientable census
          triangulations are recognised immediately).
        - The MPI census utility tricensus-mpi supports more fine-grained
          slave tasks (see --depth), amongst other improvements.  A new tool
          tricensus-mpi-status is also available for summarising the logs.
        - The utility trisetcmp supports subcomplex testing as well as
          isomorphism testing.
        - The embedded SnapPea engine can be configured to examine closed
          triangulations as well as ideal triangulations (see the Regina
          configuration panel).
    Optimisations:
        - Census generation in the closed minimal P2-irreducible case
          is *much* faster (as in orders of magnitude faster).
        - The triangulation composition tab is no longer extremly slow to
          update when working with very large data files.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed occasional crashes that occurred when deleting a
          triangulation that was currently in use.

Version 4.2.1  [ 18 September, 2005 ]

    Features:
        - New utility trisetcmp for comparing sets of triangulations.
    Improvements:
        - Documented imports and exports in the reference manual.
        - Expanded the closed non-orientable census to eight tetrahedra.
        - Added additional isomorphism routines to the calculation engine.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed "regina-engine-config --cflags", which wrote includes
          for Regina's dependencies but not for Regina itself (sigh).
        - Refuse to export a triangulation to SnapPea format if it has
          boundary faces.

Version 4.2  [ 7 July, 2005 ]

    Features:
        - Includes portions of the SnapPea kernel!  Thanks again to
          Jeff Weeks for his support.  SnapPea calculations appear in
          the "SnapPea" tab in the triangulation viewer.
        - Real boundary components can be coned to form ideal vertices.
        - Several ready-made example triangulations added to the "New
          Triangulation" dialog.
        - Triangulations can be exported to C++ source code.
        - New MPI-enabled census generation tool for use on clusters
          (tricensus-mpi).
        - New regina-engine-config script makes it easier to build
          Regina's mathematical core into your own applications.
    Improvements:
        - Build scripts improved to work out-of-the-box in more diverse
          environments.
        - Recognition of more small ad-hoc triangulations in the "Composition"
          tab, including some very small SnapPea census triangulations.
        - Uneditable packets now show a padlock in the visual packet tree.
        - Renamed "Ideal to Finite" to "Truncate Ideal Vertices".
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed bug in which output from newer versions of GAP could not be
          understood (i.e., "Simplify using GAP" is once again available).
        - Fixed a couple of crashes (keypresses in large tables of
          coordinates; 2-0 edge moves involving boundary faces).
        - Fixed bug in which triangulations containing invalid edges
          gave incorrect vertex link calculations.

Version 4.1.3  [ 25 July, 2004 ]

    Features:
        - New "Open Example" menu item for easy access to sample files
          and census data.
        - Includes the closed hyperbolic census of Hodgson and Weeks.
        - Allows the choice of text editor component to be configured.
        - Improved handling of keyboard focus.
    Scripting:
        - Operator == behaves more intuitively for mathematical objects.
          A single mathematical object in the calculation engine may
          have several Python wrapper objects.  The usual Python == tests
          whether two wrappers are in fact the same wrapper object; this
          has now been changed to test whether two wrappers wrap the same
          underlying mathematical object.
        - Fixed scripting in the GUI, which was broken under Python 2.3
          (indented blocks were treated as complete after just one line).
          Note that the command-line tool regina-python was never affected.
        - Added a sample Python session illustrating progress reporting.
    Optimisations:
        - Fixed the massive resource drain when editing script
          variables in a very large data file.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed broken scripting in the GUI (see above).
        - Several fixes and workarounds to make Regina work properly
          with the Vim editor component.
        - Tighter handling of read-only mode for packet viewers.

Version 4.1.2  [ 14 June, 2004 ]

    Features:
        - Allows fundamental groups to be further simplified using GAP
          (Groups, Algorithms and Programming).
    Documentation:
        - Expansion of the troubleshooting section, especially with
          regard to building Regina from source.
        - Overhauled the website and README.txt for greater clarity.
        - Included a suggested form for citing Regina.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Better support out of the box for more platforms, specifically
          including Red Hat and Fedora Core (many thanks to Craig
          Macintyre for his patience and assistance with this).
        - Fixed compile error when building against an STL-enabled Qt.
        - More KDE 3.2 compatibility updates.

        - 3-sphere recognition.
        - Full connected sum decomposition for closed orientable
          triangulations.
        - Conversion to 0-efficient triangulations for closed orientable
          3-manifolds.
        - Automated construction of orientable Seifert fibred spaces over
          the sphere with up to three exceptional fibres.
        - Better recognition of small multiple-vertex triangulations.
    Usability:
        - Each packet type now offers its own menu of possible actions,
          e.g., "Triangulation" menu, "Script" menu, etc.
        - Thorough use of "What's This?" help and tooltips across the
          entire user interface.
        - New tip-of-the-day support.
        - Added an index of common tasks to the reference manual.
        - Various other enhancements for improved feedback and ease of use.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed bug in "tricensus --genpairs" that caused empty output files.
        - Updates for compatibility with KDE 3.2.

Version 4.0.1  [ 26 January, 2004 ]

        - Better compile-time magic to select the correct --prefix
          automatically and to detect whether the Qt version is sufficient.
        - No longer requires docbook-utils and its complicated
          dependencies (instead Regina ships with pregenerated manpages).
        - Expanded troubleshooting section of the reference manual.

Version 4.0  [ 20 December, 2003 ]

          calculation engine) is now available through the Help menu.
        - Improved simplification of group presentations.
        - More clean-ups in the underlying mathematical code.
        - Python users should note that some normal surface properties
          now return an NTriBool instead of 1/-1/0 for true/false/unknown.

Version 3.97  [ 24 November, 2003 ] - Final prerelease for version 4.0.

    Features:
        - Python scripting is once more incorporated into the graphical
          user interface, as it was in the old days of Java.  It can be
          accessed through the Tools menu or through script packets.
          Note that synchronisation between python and the GUI is much
          better than it was in versions 3.2 and below.
        - Implemented census lookup for triangulations, using the
          censuses shipped with Regina as the default set.
        - Added recognition for trivial non-orientable triangulations.
        - Added recognition for central normal surfaces.
        - Can flatten a layered solid torus to a Mobius band (currently
          available only through the Python interface).
        - Many more configuration options are available.
        - Added a Python caveats section to the reference manual.
    Optimisations:
        - More optimisations for non-orientable census creation using
          new face pairing graph results (see math.GT/0307382:v2).
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed some problems with word wrapping and line endings in the
          embedded text editor.
        - Fixed a bug in the updating of tetrahedron labels when a tetrahedron
          is removed from a triangulation.
        - Fixed some of the compile-time ./configure tests which were broken
          on some systems (in particular some redhat-based systems).

Version 3.96  [ 31 October, 2003 ] - Second prerelease for version 4.0.

    Features:
        - Incorporated Turaev-Viro invariants and isomorphism testing
          into the user interface (previously these were available only
          through python scripting).
        - Wrote the final missing pieces of the reference manual.
        - Various clean-ups in the underlying mathematical code.
    Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed a crash when refreshing the triangulation composition tab.
        - Fixed the annoying splitter auto-resize in the main window.

Version 3.95  [ 12 October, 2003 ] - Prerelease for version 4.0.

    User Interface Rewrites:
        - The graphical user interface has been completely rewritten in C++
          using the KDE libraries.  It is much faster and cleaner, and no
          longer relies on Java support.  The user interface can be started
          by running "regina-kde".
        - Python scripting now uses standard Python, not Jython.  The API
          is much closer to that of the C++ calculation engine and
          everything has been moved into the single module "regina".
          A python session can be started by running "regina-python".
    Features:
        - Better and more consistent support for recognising standard
          triangulations and their underlying 3-manifolds.
        - Calculates Turaev-Viro invariants of triangulations.
        - Finds isomorphic copies of bounded triangulations within
          larger triangulations.
        - External objects can now be automatically notified of changes
          to packets and packet trees.

Version 3.2  [ 22 June, 2003 ] - The post-thesis release!

    Features:
        - Layered loops can be automatically constructed.
        - Much better recognition of common names for Seifert fibred spaces.
        - New utility regconcat for merging data files.
    Optimisations:
        - Significant performance increase for census generation, especially
          in the non-orientable case, due to the use of results regarding
          face pairing graphs.
        - Significant performance increase for 0-efficiency calculation,
          obtained by using quad space where possible.
    Miscellaneous:
        - Added closed orientable census, closed non-orientable census
          and splitting surface signature census to example files.
        - File format is fully documented in the reference manual.
        - Calculation engine test suite much enhanced.
        - PhD thesis submitted on 30 May, 2003!

    - Introduced various command-line utility programs.
    - Reference manual much enhanced.
    - The Great STL Port: calculation engine completely reworked to use
      and play well with the C++ Standard Template Library.  Also made
      more standards-compliant (i.e., compiles under gcc3) and put in
      its own namespace (regina).
    - Removed CORBA engine/interface (see CHANGES.txt for why).
    - Happy birthday to me!

      triangular / spiralled / augmented triangular solid torus).
    - Recognises specific face types in a triangulation.
    - Crushes normal surfaces to a point.
    - More triangulation properties (0-efficient, has splitting surface).

      splitting surface, 2-sided).
    - 4-4 moves can be performed on a triangulation.
    - Imports and exports Regina files and scripts.
    - Jython scripting behaves more naturally.
